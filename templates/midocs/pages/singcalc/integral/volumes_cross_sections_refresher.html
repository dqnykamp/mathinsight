{% description "Calculating the volume of a solid by integrating the area of its cross sections." %}

<p>Next to computing {% intlink area_definite_integrals_refresher %}areas of regions in the plane{%endintlink%}, the easiest <i>concept</i> of application of the ideas of calculus is to computing
volumes of solids where somehow we know a formula for the <i>areas
of slices</i>, that is, <i>areas of cross sections</i>. Of course, in any
particular example, the actual issue of getting the formula for the
cross section, and figuring out the appropriate limits of integration,
can be difficult.</p>

<p>The idea is to
just &lsquo;add them up&rsquo;:
$$\hbox{ volume }=\int_{\hbox{left limit}}^{\hbox{right limit}} 
\hbox{ (area of cross section at $x$) }\;dx$$
where in whatever manner we describe the solid it extends from
$x=$<i>left limit</i> to $x=$<i>right limit</i>. We must suppose
that we have some reasonable <i>formula</i> for the area of the cross
section.</p>

<p>For example, let's find the volume of a solid ball of radius $1$. (In
effect, we'll be deriving the formula for this). We can
suppose that the ball is centered at the origin. Since the radius is
$1$, the range of $x$ coordinates is from $-1$ to $+1$, so $x$ will be
integrated from $-1$ to $+1$. At a particular value of $x$, what does
the cross section look like? A disk, whose radius we'll have to
determine. To determine this radius, look at how the solid ball
intersects the $x,y$-plane: it intesects in the disk $x^2+y^2\le
1$. For a particular value of $x$, the values of $y$ are between
$\pm\sqrt{1-x^2}$. This line segment, having $x$ fixed and $y$ in this
range, is the intersection of the cross section disk with the
$x,y$-plane, and in fact is a <i>diameter</i> of that cross section
disk. Therefore, the radius of the cross section disk at $x$ is
$\sqrt{1-x^2}$. Use the formula that the area of a disk of radius $r$
is $\pi r^2$: the area of the cross section is
$$\hbox{ cross section at $x$ } = \pi(\sqrt{1-x^2})^2 = \pi(1-x^2) $$
Then integrate this from $-1$ to $+1$ to get the volume:
\begin{align*}
\hbox{ volume } &amp;= \int_{\rm left}^{\rm right}\,\hbox{area of
cross-section}\,dx\\ 
&amp;= \int_{-1}^{+1}\, \pi(1-x^2)\,dx = \pi[x-{x^3\over 3}]_{-1}^{+1}\\
&amp;= \pi[(1-{1\over 3}) - (-1-{(-1)^3 \over 3})] = {2\over 3} + {2\over
3} 
= {4\over 3}
\end{align*}</p>
