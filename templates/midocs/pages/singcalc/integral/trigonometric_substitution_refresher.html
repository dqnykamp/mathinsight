<p>This section continues development of relatively special tricks to do
special kinds of integrals. Even though the application of such things
is limited, it's nice to be <i>aware</i> of the possibilities, at least
a little bit.</p>

<p>The key idea here is to use trig functions to be able to
&lsquo;take the square root&rsquo; in certain integrals. There are just three
prototypes for the kind of thing we can deal with:
$$\sqrt{1-x^2}\;\;\;\;\;\sqrt{1+x^2}\;\;\;\;\;\sqrt{x^2-1}$$
Examples will illustrate the point.</p>

<p>In rough terms, the idea is that in an integral where the
&lsquo;worst&rsquo; part is $\sqrt{1-x^2}$, replacing $x$ by $\sin u$ (and,
correspondingly, $dx$ by $\cos u\;du$), <i>we will be able to take
the square root</i>, and then obtain an integral in
the variable $u$ which is one of the <i>trigonometric integrals</i>
which in principle we now know how to do. The point is that then
$$\sqrt{1-x^2}=\sqrt{1-\sin^2x}=\sqrt{\cos^2x}=\cos x$$
We have &lsquo;taken the square root&rsquo;.</p>

<p>For example, in
$$\int \sqrt{1-x^2}\;dx$$
we replace $x$ by $\sin u$ and $dx$ by $\cos u\,du$ to obtain
$$\int \sqrt{1-x^2}\;dx=\int \sqrt{1-\sin^2u}\;\cos u\;du=
\int \sqrt{\cos^2u}\;\cos u\;du=$$
$$=\int\cos u \;\cos u\;du=\int\cos^2u\;du$$
Now we have an integral we know how to integrate: using the half-angle
formula, this is
$$\int\cos^2u\;du=\int{1+\cos 2u\over 2}\;du={u\over 2}+{\sin
2u\over 4}+C$$
And there still remains the issue of <i>substituting back</i> to obtain
an expression in terms of $x$ rather than $u$. Since $x=\sin u$, it's
just the definition of <i>inverse function</i> that
$$u=\arcsin x$$
To express $\sin 2u$ in terms of $x$ is more aggravating. We use another
<i>half-angle formula</i> 
$$\sin 2u=2\sin u\cos u$$
Then
$${1\over 4}\sin 2u={1\over 4}\cdot 2\sin u\cos
u={1\over 4}x\cdot\sqrt{1-x^2}$$
where &lsquo;of course&rsquo; we used the Pythagorean identity to give us
$$\cos u=\sqrt{1-\sin^2u}=\sqrt{1-x^2}$$
Whew.</p>

<p>The next type of integral we can &lsquo;improve&rsquo; is one containing
an expression 
$$\sqrt{1+x^2}$$
In this case, we use another Pythagorean identity
$$1+\tan^2u=\sec^2u$$
(which we can get from the usual one $\cos^2u+\sin^2u=1$ by dividing
by $\cos^2u$). So we'd let
$$x=\tan u\;\;\;\;\;dx=\sec^2u\;du$$
(mustn't forget the $dx$ and $du$ business!).</p>

<p>For example, in
$$\int { \sqrt{1+x^2} \over x }\;dx$$
we use
$$x=\tan u\;\;\;\;\;dx=\sec^2u\;du$$
and turn the integral into
\begin{align*}\int { \sqrt{1+x^2} \over x }\;dx&amp;=\int
{ \sqrt{1+\tan^2 u} \over \tan u }\sec^2u\;du\\
&amp;=\int { \sqrt{\sec^2u} \over \tan u }\sec^2u\;du\\
&amp;=
\int {\sec u\over \tan u}\sec^2u\;du=\int {1\over \sin u\cos^2u}\;du
\end{align*}
by rewriting everything in terms of $\cos u$ and $\sin u$.</p>

<p>For integrals containing $\sqrt{x^2-1}$, use $x=\sec u$ in
order to invoke the Pythagorean identity
$$\sec^2u-1=\tan^2u$$
so as to be able to &lsquo;take the square root&rsquo;. Let's not execute any
examples of this, since nothing new really happens.</p>

<p><i>Rather,</i>, let's examine some <i>purely
algebraic variants</i> of these trigonometric substitutions, where we can
get some mileage out of <i>completing the square</i>. For example,
consider 
$$\int\sqrt{-2x-x^2}\;dx$$
The quadratic polynomial inside the square-root is <i>not</i> one of
the three simple types we've looked at. But, by completing the square,
we'll be able to rewrite it in essentially such forms:
$$-2x-x^2=-(2x+x^2)=-(-1+1+2x+x^2)=-(-1+(1+x)^2)=1-(1+x)^2$$
Note that always when completing the square we &lsquo;take out&rsquo; the
coefficient in front of $x^2$ in order to see what's going on, and
then put it back at the end.</p>

<p>So, in this case, we'd let
$$\sin u=1+x\;\;\;\;\;\cos u\;du=dx$$</p>

<p>In another example, we might have
$$\int\sqrt{8x-4x^2}\;dx$$
Completing the square again, we have
$$8x-4x^2=-4(-2+x^2)=-4(-1+1-2x+x^2)=-4(-1+(x-1)^2)$$
Rather than put the whole &lsquo;$-4$&rsquo; back, we only keep track of the
$\pm$, and take a &lsquo;$+4$&rsquo; outside the square root entirely:
\begin{align*}
\int\sqrt{8x-4x^2}\;dx&amp;=\int\sqrt{-4(-1+(x-1)^2)}\;dx\\
&amp;=2\int\sqrt{-(-1+(x-1)^2)}\;dx\\
&amp;=2\int\sqrt{1-(x-1)^2)}\;dx
\end{align*}
Then we're back to a familiar situation.</p>
