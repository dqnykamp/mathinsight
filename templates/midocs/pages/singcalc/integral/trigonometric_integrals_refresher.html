{% description "Using trigonometric identities to calculate integrals involving trigonometric functions." %}

<p>Here we'll just have a <i>sample</i> of how to use trig identities to
do some more complicated integrals involving trigonometric
functions. This is &lsquo;just the tip of the iceberg&rsquo;. We don't do more for
at least two reasons: first, hardly anyone remembers all these tricks
anyway, and, second, in real life you can look these things up in
tables of integrals. Perhaps even more important, in &lsquo;real life&rsquo; there
are more sophisticated viewpoints which even make the whole issue a
little silly, somewhat like evaluating $\sqrt{26}$ &lsquo;{%intlink linear_approximation_differentials_refresher%}by differentials{%endintlink%}&rsquo;
without your calculator seems silly.</p>

<p>The only identities we'll need in our examples are
$$\cos^2x+\sin^2x=1\;\;\;\;\;\hbox{ Pythagorean identity}$$
$$\sin\,x=\sqrt{1-\cos\,2x\over 2}\;\;\;\;\;\hbox{ half-angle formula}$$
$$\cos\,x=\sqrt{1+\cos\,2x\over 2}\;\;\;\;\;\hbox{ half-angle formula}$$</p>

<p>The first example is
$$\int \sin^3 x\;dx.$$
If we ignore all trig identities, there is no easy way to do this
integral. But if we use the Pythagorean identity to rewrite it, then
things improve:
$$\int \sin^3 x\;dx=\int (1-\cos^2x)\sin x\;dx=-\int (1-\cos^2x)(-\sin x)\;dx$$
In the latter expression, we can view the $-\sin x$ as the derivative
of $\cos x$, so with the substitution $u=\cos x$ this integral is
$$-\int (1-u^2)\;du=-u+{u^3\over 3}+C=-\cos x+{\cos^3x\over 3}+C$$</p>

<p>This idea can be applied, more generally, to integrals
$$\int \sin^m x\;\cos^n x\; dx$$
where <i>at least one of $m,n$ is odd</i>. For example, if $n$ is odd,
then use
$$\cos ^nx=\cos^{n-1}x\;\cos x=(1-\sin^2x)^{n-1\over 2}\;\cos x$$
to write the whole thing as
$$\int \sin^m x\;\cos^n x\; dx=
\int \sin^m x\;(1-\sin^2x)^{n-1\over 2}\;\cos x\;dx$$
The point is that we have obtained something of the form
$$\int\hbox{ (polynomial in $\sin x$) }\cos x\;dx$$
Letting $u=\sin x$, we have $\cos x\;dx=du$, and the integral becomes 
$$\hbox{ (polynomial in $u$) } du$$
which we can do.</p>

<p>But this Pythagorean identity trick does not help us on the
relatively simple-looking integral 
$$\int \sin^2 x\; dx$$ 
since there is no odd exponent anywhere. In effect, we &lsquo;divide the
exponent by two&rsquo;, thereby getting an odd exponent, by using the <i>half-angle formula</i>:
$$\int \sin^2 x\; dx= \int
{1-\cos\,2x\over 2}\;dx={x\over 2}-{\sin 2x\over 2\cdot 2}+C$$</p>

<p>A bigger version of this application of the half-angle
formula is
$$\int \sin^6 x \; dx=\int ({1-\cos\,2x\over 2})^3\;dx=
\int {1\over 8}-{3\over 8}\cos 2x + {3\over 8}\cos^2 2x -
{1\over 8}\cos^3 2x\;dx$$
Of the four terms in the integrand in the last expression, we can do
the first two directly:
$$\int {1\over 8}\;dx={x\over 8}+C\;\;\;\;\;
\int -{3\over 8}\cos 2x\;dx= {-3\over 16}\sin 2x+C$$
But the last two terms require further work: using a half-angle
formula <i>again</i>, we have
$$\int {3\over 8}\cos^2 2x\;dx=\int {3\over 16}(1+\cos 4x)\;dx=
{3x\over 16}+{3\over 64}\sin 4x+C$$
And the $\cos^3 2x$ needs the Pythagorean identity trick:
$$\int {1\over 8}\cos^3 2x\;dx={1\over 8}\int (1-\sin^22x)\cos
2x\;dx
={1\over 8}[\sin 2x-{\sin^3 2x\over 3}]+C$$
Putting it all together, we have
$$\int \sin^6 x \; dx={x\over 8}+{-3\over 16}\sin 2x+
{3x\over 16}+{3\over 64}\sin 4x+{1\over 8}[\sin 2x-{\sin^3
2x\over 3}]+C$$
This last example is typical of the kind of repeated application of
all the tricks necessary in order to treat all the possibilities.</p>

<p>In a slightly different vein, there is the horrible
$$\int \sec x\;dx$$
There is no decent way to do this at all from a first-year calculus
viewpoint. A sort of rationalized-in-hindsight way of explaining the
answer is:
$$\int \sec x\;dx=\int {\sec x(\sec x+\tan x)\over \sec x+\tan
x}\;dx$$
All we did was multiply and divide by $\sec x+\tan x$. Of course, we
don't pretend to answer the question of how a person would get the
idea to do this. But then (another miracle?) we &lsquo;notice&rsquo; that the
numerator is the derivative of the denominator, so
$$\int \sec x\;dx=\ln(\sec x+\tan x)+C$$
There is something distasteful about this rationalization, but at this
level of technique we're stuck with it.</p>

<p>Maybe this is enough of a sample. There are several other
tricks that one would have to know in order to claim to be an &lsquo;expert&rsquo;
at this, but it's not really sensible to <i>want</i> to be &lsquo;expert&rsquo; at
these games, <i>because there are smarter alternatives.</i></p>
