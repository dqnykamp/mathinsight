{% description "Calculating the volume of created by rotating a plane region around some axis." %}

<p>Another way of computing volumes of some special types of solid
figures applies to solids obtained by <i>rotating plane regions</i>
about some axis.</p>

<p>If we rotate the plane region described by $f(x)\le y\le g(x)$
and $a\le x\le b$ <b>around the $x$-axis</b>, the volume of the resulting
solid is
\begin{align*}
\hbox{ volume }&amp;=\int_a^b \pi (g(x)^2-f(x)^2)\;dx\\
&amp;=\int_{\hbox{left limit}}^{\hbox{right limit}}
 \pi (\hbox{upper curve}^2-\hbox{lower curve}^2)\;dx
\end{align*}
It is necessary to suppose that $f(x)\ge 0$ for this to be right.</p>

<p>This formula comes from viewing the whole thing as sliced up
into slices of thickness $dx$, so that each slice is a <i>disk</i> of
radius $g(x)$ with a smaller disk of radius $f(x)$ removed from
it. Then we use the formula $$\hbox{ area of disk }= \pi \hbox{
radius}^2$$ and &lsquo;add them all up&rsquo;. The hypothesis that $f(x)\ge 0$ is
necessary to avoid different pieces of the solid &lsquo;overlap&rsquo; each other
by accident, thus counting the same chunk of volume <i>twice</i>.</p>

<p>If we rotate the plane region described by $f(x)\le y\le g(x)$
and $a\le x\le b$ <b>around the $y$-axis</b> (instead of the $x$-axis), the
volume of the resulting solid is 
\begin{align*}
\hbox{ volume }&amp;=\int_a^b 2\pi
x(g(x)-f(x))\;dx\\
&amp;=\int_{\hbox{left}}^{\hbox{ right}} 
2\pi x(\hbox{ upper - lower})\;dx
\end{align*}</p>

<p>This second formula comes from viewing the whole thing as
sliced up into thin cylindrical shells of thickness $dx$ encircling
the $y$-axis, of radius $x$ and of height $g(x)-f(x)$. The volume of each
one is 
$$\hbox{ (area of cylinder of height $g(x)-f(x)$ and radius $x$) }\cdot dx=
2\pi x(g(x)-f(x))\;dx$$ 
and &lsquo;add them all up&rsquo; in the integral.</p>

<p>As an example, let's consider the region $0\le x \le 1$ and
$x^2\le y \le x$. Note that for $0\le x \le 1$ it really is the
case that $x^2\le y \le x$, so $y=x$ is the <i>upper</i> curve of the
two, and $y=x^2$ is the <i>lower</i> curve of the two. Invoking the
formula above, the volume of the solid obtained by rotating this
plane region around the <i>x-axis</i> is
\begin{align*}
\hbox{ volume }&amp;=\int_{\hbox{left}}^{\hbox{ right}}
\pi (\hbox{upper}^2-\hbox{lower}^2)\;dx\\
&amp;=\int_0^1 \pi ((x)^2-(x^2)^2)\; dx = \pi [ x^3/3 - x^5/5]_0^1 =
\pi(1/3 - 1/5)
\end{align*} </p>

<p>On the other hand, if we rotate this <b>around the $y$-axis</b>
instead, then
\begin{align*}
\hbox{ volume }&amp;=\int_{\hbox{left}}^{\hbox{ right}}
2\pi x (\hbox{upper}-\hbox{lower})\;dx\\
&amp;= \int_0^1 \, 2\pi x (x-x^2)\, dx 
= \pi\int_0^1 \, {2x^3 \over 3} - {2x^4 \over 4} \, dx 
= [{2x^3 \over 3} - {2x^4 \over 4}]_0^1 = {2\over 3} - {1\over 2} =
{1\over 6} 
\end{align*}</p>
