<p>Strangely, the subtlest standard method is just the <i>{% intlink "product_rule_refresher" %}product rule{%endintlink%}</i>
run backwards. This is called <b>integration by parts</b>. (This might
seem strange because often people find the {% intlink "chain_rule_refresher" %}chain rule{%endintlink%} for
differentiation harder to get a grip on than the product rule). One
way of writing the integration by parts rule is $$\int f(x)\cdot
g'(x)\;dx=f(x)g(x)-\int f'(x)\cdot g(x)\;dx$$ Sometimes this is
written another way: if we use the notation that for a function $u$ of
$x$,
$$du={du\over dx}\;dx$$
then for two functions $u,v$ of $x$ the rule is
$$\int u\;dv=uv-\int v\;du.$$</p>

<p>Yes, it is hard to see how this might be helpful, but it
is. The first theme we'll see in examples is where we could do the
integral except that there is a power of $x$ &lsquo;in the way&rsquo;:</p>

<p>The simplest example is
$$\int x\;e^x\;dx=\int x\;d(e^x)=x\,e^x-\int e^x\;dx=x\,e^x-e^x+C$$
Here we have taken $u=x$ and $v=e^x$. It is important to be able to
see the $e^x$ as being the derivative of itself.</p>

<p>A similar example is
$$\int x\;\cos x\;dx=\int x\;d(\sin x)=
x\,\sin x-\int \sin x\;dx=x\,\sin x+\cos x +C$$
Here we have taken $u=x$ and $v=\sin x$. It is important to be able to
see the $\cos x$ as being the derivative of $\sin x$.</p>

<p>Yet another example, illustrating also the idea of <i>repeating</i>
the integration by parts:
\begin{align*}
\int x^2\;e^x\;dx&amp;=\int x^2\;d(e^x)=x^2\,e^x-\int e^x\;d(x^2)\\
&amp;=x^2\,e^x-2 \int x\,e^x\;dx=x^2\,e^x-2x\,e^x+2\int e^x\;dx\\
&amp;=x^2\,e^x-2x\,e^x+2e^x+C
\end{align*}
Here we integrate by parts twice. After the first integration by
parts, the integral we come up with is $\int xe^x\,dx$, which we had
dealt with in the first example.</p>

<p>Or sometimes the theme is that it is easier to integrate the
<i>derivative</i> of something than to integrate the thing:
\begin{align*}
\int \ln x\;dx&amp;=\int \ln x\;d(x)=x\ln x-\int x\; d(\ln x)\\
&amp;=x\ln x-\int x\;{1\over x}\; dx=x\ln x-\int 1\; dx=x\ln x-x+C
\end{align*}
We took $u=\ln x$ and $v=x$.</p>

<p>Again in this example it is easier to integrate the
derivative than the thing itself:
\begin{align*}
\int \arctan x\;dx&amp;=\int \arctan x\;d(x)=x\arctan x-\int x\;
d(\arctan x)\\
&amp;=x\arctan x-\int {x\over 1+x^2}\;dx
=x\arctan x-{1\over 2}\int {2x\over 1+x^2}\;dx\\
&amp;=x\arctan x-{1\over 2}\ln(1+x^2)+C
\end{align*}
since we should recognize the
$${2x\over 1+x^2}$$
as being the derivative (via the {% intlink "chain_rule_refresher" %}chain rule{%endintlink%}) of $\ln(1+x^2)$.</p>
