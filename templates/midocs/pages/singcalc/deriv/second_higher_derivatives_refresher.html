<p>The <b>second derivative</b> of a function is simply <i>the
derivative of the derivative</i>. The <b>third derivative</b> of a
function is the derivative of the second derivative. And so on.</p>

<p>The second derivative of a function $y=f(x)$ is written as
$$y''=f''(x)={d^2\over dx\,^2}f={d^2\,f\over dx\,^2}={d^2\,y\over dx\,^2}$$
The third derivative is
$$y'''
=f'''(x)={d^3\over dx\,^3}f={d^3\,f\over dx\,^3}={d^3\,y\over dx\,^3}$$
And, generally, we can put on a &lsquo;prime&rsquo; for each derivative taken. Or
write
$${d^n\over dx\,^n}f={d^n\,f\over dx\,^n}={d^n\,y\over dx\,^n}$$
for the $n$th derivative. There is yet another notation for high order
derivatives where the number of &lsquo;primes&rsquo; would become unwieldy:
$${d^n\,f\over dx\,^n}=f^{(n)}(x)$$
as well.</p>

<p>The geometric interpretation of the higher derivatives is subtler than
that of the first derivative, and we won't do much in this direction,
except for the {% intlink "inflection_points_concavity_upward_downward_refresher" %}next little section{%endintlink%}.</p>
