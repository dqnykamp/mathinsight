<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>The quotient rule for differentiation follows directly from the {% intlink "product_rule_idea" %}product rule{%endintlink%} with just a few manipulations.  Let $f$ be the quotient of $g$ and $h$,
\begin{align*}
f(x) = \frac{g(x)}{h(x)},
\end{align*}
where $h(x) \ne 0$.  We want a formula for $f'(x)$ in terms of $g$, $h$, and their derivatives.  We can find a relationship among $f$, $g$, $h$, and their derivatives by multiplying through by $h$
\begin{align*}
f(x)h(x) = g(x)
\end{align*}
and then applying the {% intlink "product_rule_idea" %}product rule{%endintlink%}
\begin{align*}
f'(x)h(x) + f(x)h'(x) = g'(x)
\end{align*}
to get the derivative of $g$ in terms of $f$, $h$, and their derivatives.  We subtract $f(x)h'(x)$ and divide by $h(x)$ to solve for $f'(x)$,
\begin{align*}
f'(x)= \frac{g'(x) -f(x)h'(x)}{h(x)}.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>We are getting closer, but we want a formula for $f'$ just in terms of $g$, $h$, and their derivatives.  We can get rid of the $f(x)$ on the right hand side by substituting the definition $f(x)=g(x)/h(x)$,
\begin{align*}
f'(x)= \frac{g'(x) -\frac{g(x)}{h(x)}h'(x)}{h(x)},
\end{align*}
and eliminate the fraction in the numerator by multiplying numerator and denominator by $h(x)$,
\begin{align*}
f'(x)= \frac{h(x)g'(x) -g(x)h'(x)}{[h(x)]^2}.
\end{align*}
We have derived the quotient rule for the differentiation.
We could rewrite it explicitly as the derivative of a quotient,
\begin{align}
\left(\frac{g(x)}{h(x)}\right)'= \frac{h(x)g'(x) -g(x)h'(x)}{[h(x)]^2}
  \label{quotient_rule1}
\end{align}
or
\begin{align}
\diff{}{x}\left(\frac{g}{h}\right)= \frac{h\diff{g}{x} -g\diff{h}{x}}{h^2}.
  \label{quotient_rule2}
\end{align}
