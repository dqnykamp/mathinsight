{% title "Minimization and maximization refresher" %}
{% description "How to calculate the maxima and minima of a differentiable function." %}


<p>The fundamental idea which makes calculus useful in understanding
problems of maximizing and minimizing things is that at a <i>peak</i>
of the graph of a function, or at the bottom of a <i>trough</i>, the
{% intlink "tangent_normal_lines_refresher" %}tangent{%endintlink%} is <i>horizontal</i>. That is, <i>the derivative $f'(x_o)$ is
$0$ at points $x_o$ at which $f(x_o)$ is a maximum or a minimum</i>.</p>

<p>Well, a little sharpening of this is necessary: sometimes for either
natural or artificial reasons the variable $x$ is restricted to some
interval $[a,b]$. In that case, we can say that <i>the maximum and
minimum values of $f$ on the interval $[a,b]$ occur among the list of
{% intlink "critical_points_monotone_increase_decrease_refresher" %}critical points{%endintlink%} and endpoints of the interval</i>.</p>

<p>And, if there are points where $f$ is not differentiable, or is
discontinuous, then these have to be added in, too. But let's stick
with the basic idea, and just ignore some of these complications.</p>

<p class="pre_list">Let's describe a systematic procedure to find the minimum and maximum
values of a function $f$ on an interval $[a,b]$.</p>
<ul>
<li>Solve $f'(x)=0$ to find the list of critical points of $f$.</li>
<li>Exclude any critical points not inside the interval $[a,b]$.</li>
<li>Add to the list the <i>endpoints</i> $a,b$ of the interval (and
any points of discontinuity or non-differentiability!)</li>
<li>At each point on the list, evaluate the function $f$: the
biggest number that occurs is the maximum, and the littlest number
that occurs is the minimum.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>Find the minima and maxima of the
function $f(x)=x^4-8x^2+5$ on the interval $[-1,3]$. First, take the
derivative and set it equal to zero to solve for critical points: this
is
$$4x^3-16x=0$$
or, more simply, dividing by $4$, it is $x^3-4x=0$. Luckily, we
can see how to factor this: it is
$$x(x-2)(x+2)$$
So the critical points are $-2,0,+2$. Since the interval does not
include $-2$, we drop it from our list. And we <i>add</i> to the list
the endpoints $-1,3$. So the list of numbers to consider as potential
spots for minima and maxima are $-1,0,2,3$. Plugging these numbers
into the function, we get (in that order) $-2, 5, -11, 14$. Therefore,
the maximum is $14$, which occurs at $x=3$, and the minimum is $-11$,
which occurs at $x=2$.</p>

<p>Notice that in the previous example the maximum did not occur
at a critical point, but by coincidence did occur at an endpoint.</p>


<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>You have $200$ feet of fencing with which you
wish to enclose the largest possible rectangular garden.  What is
the largest garden you can have? </p>

<p>Let $x$ be the length of the garden, and $y$ the width. Then the area
is simply $xy$. Since the perimeter is $200$, we know that
$2x+2y=200$, which we can solve to express $y$ as a function of $x$:
we find that $y=100-x$. Now we can rewrite the area as a function of
$x$ alone, which sets us up to execute our procedure:
$$area = xy=x(100-x)$$
The derivative of this function with respect to $x$ is
$100-2x$. Setting this equal to $0$ gives the equation
$$100-2x=0$$
to solve for critical points: we find just <i>one</i>, namely
$x=50$. </p>

<p>Now what about endpoints? What is the interval? In this example we
must look at &lsquo;physical&rsquo; considerations to figure out what interval $x$
is restricted to. Certainly a <i>width</i> must be a positive number,
so $x>0$ and $y>0$. Since $y=100-x$, the inequality on $y$ gives
another inequality on $x$, namely that $x
<100$. So $x$ is in
$[0,100]$. </p>

<p>When we plug the values $0,50,100$ into the function $x(100-x)$, we
get $0,2500,0$, in that order. Thus, the corresponding value of $y$ is
$100-50=50$, and the maximal possible area is $50\cdot 50=2500$.</p>
