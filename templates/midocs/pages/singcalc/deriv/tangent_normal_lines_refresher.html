{% description "How to compute the tangent and normal lines to the graph of a function." %}

<p>One fundamental interpretation of the derivative of a function is that
it is the <i>slope of the tangent line</i> to the graph of the
function. (Still, it is important to realize that this is <i>not
the definition</i> of the thing, and that there are other possible and
important interpretations as well).</p>

<p>The precise statement of this fundamental idea is as follows. Let $f$
be a function. For each <i>fixed</i> value $x_o$ of the input to $f$, the
value $f'(x_o)$ of the derivative $f'$ of $f$ <i>evaluated at $x_o$</i> is
the slope of the tangent line to the graph of $f$ <i>at the
particular point $(x_o,f(x_o))$ on the graph</i>.</p>

<p>Recall the <i>{% intlink "lines_algebraic_geometry_refresher" %}point-slope form{%endintlink%}</i> of a line with slope $m$ through a
point $(x_o,y_o)$:
$$y-y_o=m(x-x_o)$$
In the present context, the slope is $f'(x_o)$ and the point is
$(x_o,f(x_o))$, so <i>the equation of the tangent line to the graph
of $f$ at $(x_o,f(x_o))$ is</i>
$$y-f(x_o)=f'(x_o)(x-x_o)$$</p>

<p>The <b>normal line</b> to a curve at a particular point is the line
through that point and <i>perpendicular</i> to the tangent. A person
might remember from analytic geometry that the slope of any line <i>perpendicular to</i> a line with slope $m$ is the <i>negative
reciprocal</i> $-1/m$. Thus, just changing this aspect of the equation
for the tangent line, we can say generally that <i>the equation of
the normal line to the graph 
of $f$ at $(x_o,f(x_o))$ is</i>
$$y-f(x_o)={-1\over f'(x_o)}(x-x_o).$$</p>

<p>The main conceptual hazard is to mistakenly name the <i>fixed</i> point
&lsquo;$x$&rsquo;, as well as naming the <i>variable</i> coordinate on the tangent
line &lsquo;$x$&rsquo;. This causes a person to write down some equation which,
whatever it may be, is <i>not</i> the equation of a line at all.</p>

<p>Another popular boo-boo is to forget the subtraction $-f(x_o)$ on the
left hand side. Don't do it.</p>

<p>So, as the simplest example: let's write the equation for the tangent
line to the curve $y=x^2$ at the point where $x=3$. The derivative of
the function is $y'=2x$, which has value $2\cdot 3=6$ when $x=3$. And
the value of the function is $3\cdot 3=9$ when $x=3$. Thus, the
<i>tangent line</i> at that point is $$y-9=6(x-3)$$ The <i>normal
line</i> at the point where $x=3$ is
$$y-9={-1\over 6}(x-3)$$</p>

<p>So the question of finding the tangent and normal lines at various
points of the graph of a function is just a combination of the two
processes: computing the derivative at the point in question, and
invoking the point-slope form of the equation for a straight line.</p>
