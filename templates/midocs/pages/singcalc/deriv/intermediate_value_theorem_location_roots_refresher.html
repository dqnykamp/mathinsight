<p>The assertion of the Intermediate Value Theorem is something which is
probably &lsquo;intuitively obvious&rsquo;, and is also <i>provably true</i>: if a
function $f$ is <i>continuous</i> on an interval $[a,b]$ and if
$f(a) < 0$ and $f(b) > 0$ (or vice-versa), then there is some third point
$c$ with $a < c < b$ so that $f(c)=0$.
This result has many relatively &lsquo;theoretical&rsquo; uses, but for our
purposes can be used to give a crude but simple way to locate the
roots of functions. There is a lot of guessing, or trial-and-error,
involved here, but that is fair. Again, in this situation, it is to
our advantage if we are reasonably proficient in using a calculator to
do simple tasks like evaluating polynomials!
If this approach to estimating roots is taken to its logical
conclusion, it is called the method of <i>interval bisection</i>, for a
reason we'll see below. We will not pursue this method very far,
because there are <i>better</i> methods to use once we have invoked
<i>this</i> just to get going.</p>


<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>For example, we probably don't know a formula to solve the cubic
equation
$$x^3-x+1=0$$
But the function $f(x)=x^3-x+1$ is certainly continuous, so we can
invoke the Intermediate Value Theorem as much as we'd like. For
example, $f(2)=7 > 0$ and $f(-2)=-5 < 0$, so we know that there is a root
in the interval $[-2,2]$. We'd like to cut down the size of the
interval, so we look at what happens at the <i>midpoint</i>, bisecting
the interval $[-2,2]$: we have $f(0)=1 > 0$. Therefore, since
$f(-2)=-5 < 0$, we can conclude that there is a root in
$[-2,0]$. Since both $f(0) > 0$ and $f(2) > 0$, we can't say anything at
this point about whether or not there are roots in $[0,2]$. Again <i>bisecting</i> the interval $[-2,0]$ where we know there is a root, we
compute $f(-1)=1 > 0$. Thus, since $f(-2) < 0$, we know that there is a
root in $[-2,-1]$ (and have no information about $[-1,0]$).</p>

<p>If we continue with this method, we can obtain as good an
approximation as we want! But there are faster ways to get a really
good approximation, as we'll see.</p>

<p>Unless a person has an amazing intuition for polynomials (or
whatever), there is really no way to anticipate what guess is better
than any other in getting started.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Invoke the Intermediate Value Theorem to find an
interval of length $1$ or less in which there is a root of $x^3+x+3
=0$: Let $f(x)=x^3+x+3$. Just, guessing, we compute
$f(0)=3 > 0$. Realizing that the $x^3$ term probably &lsquo;dominates&rsquo; $f$
when $x$ is large positive or large negative, and since we want to
find a point where $f$ is negative, our next guess will be a &lsquo;large&rsquo;
negative number: how about $-1$? Well, $f(-1)=1 > 0$, so evidently $-1$
is not negative enough. How about $-2$? Well, $f(-2)=-7 < 0$, so we have
succeeded. Further, the failed guess $-1$ actually was worthwhile,
since now we know that $f(-2) < 0$ and $f(-1) > 0$. Then, invoking the
Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a root in the interval $[-2,-1]$.</p>

<p>Of course, typically polynomials have several roots, but <i>the number of roots of a polynomial is never more than its degree</i>. We
can use the Intermediate Value Theorem to get an idea where <i>all</i>
of them are.</p>

<h4>Example 3</h4>

<p>Invoke the Intermediate Value Theorem to find <i>three
different intervals</i> of length $1$ or less in each of which there is a
root of $x^3-4x+1=0$: first, just starting anywhere, $f(0)=1 > 0$. Next,
$f(1)=-2 < 0$. So, since $f(0) > 0$ and $f(1) < 0$, there is at least one
root in $[0,1]$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem. Next,
$f(2)=1 > 0$. So, with some luck here, since $f(1) < 0$ and $f(2) > 0$, by
the Intermediate Value Theorem there is a root in $[1,2]$. Now if we
somehow imagine that there is a <i>negative root</i> as well, then we
try $-1$: $f(-1)=4 > 0$. So we know <i>nothing</i> about roots in
$[-1,0]$. But continue: $f(-2)=1 > 0$, and still no new
conclusion. Continue: $f(-3)=-14 < 0$. Aha! So since $f(-3) < 0$ and
$f(2) > 0$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem there is a <i>third</i>
root in the interval $[-3,-2]$.</p>

<p>Notice how even the &lsquo;bad&rsquo; guesses were not entirely wasted.</p>
