<p>To determine how to compute the derivative of the inverse of $f$, let's think about the derivative of $f$ in terms of the {% intlink "function_machine" %}function machine metaphor{%endintlink%}.</p>

{% image "function_machine_f" %}

<p>We have denoted the input of $f$ (the tetrahedron) by the variable $x$.  Let's denote the output of $f$ (the sphere) by the variable $y$ so that
$$y=f(x).$$
Since the derivative of $f$ is the ratio of the change in its output to the change in its input, we can write the derivative as
\begin{align*}
  \diff{f}{x}&=\frac{\text{change in output of $f$}}{\text{change in input to $f$}}\\
  &= \frac{\text{change in $y$}}{\text{change in $x$}}.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>Can we do the same thing for the inverse of $f$?  Let's use a {% intlink "function_machine_inverse" %}function machine to represent the inverse{%endintlink%} of $f$.</p>

{% image "function_machine_finv" %}

<p>We denote the inverse of $f$ by $f^{-1}$ (pronounced &ldquo;f inverse&rdquo;).  The input to $f^{-1}$ is the output of $f$ (the sphere), which we have labeled as $y$. The output of $f^{-1}$ is the input to $f$ (the tetrahedron), which we have labeled as $x$. We can write $f^{-1}$ as
$$x=f^{-1}(y).$$
</p>

<p>We can represent the derivative of $f^{-1}$ in the same was as we did for $f$.  Using that the derivative of $f^{-1}$ is the ratio of the change in its output to the change in its input, we can conclude that
\begin{align*}
  \diff{f^{-1}}{y} &=\frac{\text{change in output of $f^{-1}$}}{\text{change in input to $f^{-1}$}}\\
  &=\frac{\text{change in input to $f$}}{\text{change in output of $f$}}\\
  &= \frac{\text{change in $x$}}{\text{change in $y$}}.
\end{align*}
In other words, the derivative of $f^{-1}$ is the reciprocal of the derivative of $f$, i.e., the derivative of $f^{-1}(y)$ must be $1/f'(x)$.  However, since $f^{-1}(y)$ is a function of $y$ (the sphere) not of $x$ (the tetrahedron), we need to rewrite the derivative of $f^{-1}$ in terms of $y$.  The function $x=f^{-1}(y)$ itself is the way to transform $y$ to $x$, so we just need to plug in $f^{-1}(y)$ for $x$ in the expression $1/f'(x)$.</p>

<p>Therefore, the derivative of $f^{-1}(y)$ is
\begin{align*}
  \diff{f^{-1}}{y} &= \frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(y))}.
\end{align*}
 </p>

<p>An important example where we use this result is to calculate the derivative of the {% intlink "logarithm_basics" %}natural logarithm{%endintlink%}.  You can read a version of this page specialized to the {% intlink "derivative_natural_logarithm" %}derivative of the natural logarithm{%endintlink%}.</p>
