{% description "How to compute the derivative of a polynomial." %}

<p>There are just four simple facts which suffice to take the derivative
of any polynomial, and actually of somewhat more general
things.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="power_rule"></a>
<p>First, there is the rule for taking the derivative of a <b>power function</b> which takes the $n$th power of its input. That is,
these functions are functions of the form $f(x)=x^n$. The formula is
$${d\over dx}x^n=n\,x^{n-1}$$
That is, the exponent comes down to become a coefficient in front of
the thing, and the exponent is decreased by $1$.</p>

<p>The second rule, which is really a special case of this power-function
rule, is that <i> derivatives of constants are zero</i>:
$${d\over dx}\,c=0$$
for any constant $c$.</p>

<p>The third thing, which reflects the innocuous role of constants in
calculus, is that for <i>any</i> functions $f$ of $x$
$$\;\;{d\over dx}\,c\cdot f=c\cdot\,{d\over dx}\,f$$
The fourth is that for <i>any</i> two functions $f,g$ of $x$, <i>the
derivative of the sum is the sum of the derivatives</i>:
$${d\over dx}(f+g)={d\over dx}f+{d\over dx}g$$</p>

<p>Putting these four things together, we can write general formulas like
$${d\over dx}(ax^m+bx^n+cx^p)=a\cdot mx^{m-1}+b\cdot nx^{n-1}+
c\cdot px^{p-1}$$
and so on, with more summands than just the three, if so desired. And
in any case here are some examples with numbers instead of letters:
\begin{align*}
{d\over dx}5x^3&amp;=5\cdot 3x^{3-1}=15x^2\\
{d\over dx}(3x^7+5x^3-11)&amp;=
3\cdot7x^6+5\cdot 3x^2-0=21x^6+15x^2\\
{d\over dx}(2-3x^2-2x^3)&amp;=0-3\cdot 2x-2\cdot 3x^2=-6x-6x^2\\
{d\over dx}(-x^4+2x^5+ 1)&amp;=-4x^3+2\cdot 5x^4+0=-4x^3+10x^4
\end{align*}</p>

<p>Even if you do catch on to this idea right away, it is wise to
practice the <i> technique</i> so that not only can you do it <i> in
principle</i>, but also <i> in practice</i>. </p>
