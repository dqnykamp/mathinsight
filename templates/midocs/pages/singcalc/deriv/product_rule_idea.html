<p>As discussed in the video, the form of the product rule is so simple because one can ignore any combined effects from changing both factors simultaneously.  Instead, one calculates the derivative of a product by considering just the cases where one factor is constant and the other is variable, and adding the results to get the final derivative.</p>

<p>The below applet illustrates why this is true, for the case when calculating the derivative of the area $A(t)=x(t)y(t)$ of a rectangle with time varying width $x(t)$ and height $y(t)$.</p>
