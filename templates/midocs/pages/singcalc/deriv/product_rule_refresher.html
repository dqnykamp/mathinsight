{% title "A refresher on the product rule" %}
{% description "How to compute the derivative of a product." %}

<p>Not only will the <i>product rule</i> be of use in general and later
on, but it's already helpful in perhaps unexpected ways in dealing
with polynomials. Anyway, the general rule is
$${d\over dx}(fg)=f'g+fg'$$
While this is certainly not as awful as the {% intlink "quotient_rule_refresher" %}quotient rule{%endintlink%},
it is not as simple as the rule for sums, which was the good-sounding
slogan that <i>the derivative of the sum is the sum of the
derivatives</i>. It is <i>not</i> true that the derivative of the product
is the product of the derivatives. Too bad. Still, it's not as bad as
the quotient rule.</p>

<p>One way that the product rule can be useful is in postponing or
eliminating a lot of algebra. For example, to evaluate
$${d\over dx}\left((x^3+x^2+x+1)(x^4+x^3+2x+1)\right)$$
we <i>could</i> multiply out and then take the derivative term-by-term
as we did with several polynomials above. This would be at least
mildly irritating because we'd have to do a bit of algebra. Rather,
just apply the product rule <i>without</i> feeling compelled first to
do any algebra:
$${d\over dx}\left((x^3+x^2+x+1)(x^4+x^3+2x+1)\right)$$
$$=(x^3+x^2+x+1)'(x^4+x^3+2x+1)+(x^3+x^2+x+1)(x^4+x^3+2x+1)'$$
$$=(3x^2+2x+1)(x^4+x^3+2x+1)+(x^3+x^2+x+1)(4x^3+3x^2+2)$$
Now if we were somehow still obliged to multiply out, then we'd still
have to do some algebra. But <i>we can take the derivative without
multiplying out</i>, if we want to, by using the product rule.</p>

<p>For that matter, once we see that there is a <i>choice</i> about doing
algebra either <i>before</i> or <i>after</i> we take the derivative, it
might be possible to make a choice which minimizes our computational
labor. This could matter.</p>
