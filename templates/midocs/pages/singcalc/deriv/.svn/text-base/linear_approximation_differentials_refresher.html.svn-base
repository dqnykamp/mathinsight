{% description "Approximating the value of a function near a point by its tangent line formula." %}

<p>The idea here in &lsquo;geometric&rsquo; terms is that in some vague sense a
curved line can be approximated by a straight line tangent to it. Of
course, this approximation is only good at all &lsquo;near&rsquo; the point of
tangency, and so on. So the only formula here is secretly the formula
for the {%intlink tangent_normal_lines_refresher %}tangent line{%endintlink%} to the graph of a function. There is some hassle
due to the fact that there are so many different choices of symbols to
<i>write</i> it.</p>

<p>We can write some formulas: Let $f$ be a
function, and fix a point $x_o$. The idea is that <i>for $x$ &lsquo;near&rsquo;
$x_o$ we have an &lsquo;approximate&rsquo; equality</i>
$$f(x)\approx f(x_o)+f'(x_o)(x-x_o)$$
We do <i>not</i> attempt to clarify what <i>either</i> &lsquo;near&rsquo; or
&lsquo;approximate&rsquo; mean in this context. What is really true here is that
for a given value $x$, the quantity
$$f(x_o)+f'(x_o)(x-x_o)$$
is <i>exactly</i> the $y$-coordinate of the line <i>tangent</i> to the
graph at $x_o$.</p>

<p>The aproximation statement has many paraphrases in varying
choices of symbols, and a person needs to be able to recognize all of
them. For example, one of the more traditional paraphrases, which
introduces some slightly silly but oh-so-traditional notation, is the
following one. We might also say that $y$ is a function of $x$ given
by $y=f(x)$. Let 
$$\Delta x = \hbox{ small change in $x$}$$
$$\Delta y= \hbox{ corresponding change in $y$ }=f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)$$</p>

<p>Then the assertion is that 
$$\Delta y\approx f'(x)\,\Delta x$$</p>

<p>Sometimes some texts introduce the following questionable
(but traditionally popular!) notation:
$$dy = f'(x)\;dx = \hbox{ approximation to change in $y$}$$
$$dx = \Delta x$$
and call the $dx$ and $dy$ <i>&lsquo;differentials&rsquo;</i>. And then this whole
procedure is <b>&lsquo;approximation by differentials&rsquo;</b>. A not
particularly enlightening paraphrase, using the previous notation, is
$$dy\approx \Delta y.$$
Even though you may see people writing this, don't do it.</p>

<p>More paraphrases, with varying symbols:
$$f(x+\Delta x)\approx f(x) + f'(x)\Delta x$$
$$f(x+\delta)\approx f(x) + f'(x)\delta$$
$$f(x+h)\approx f(x) + f'(x)h$$
$$f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)\approx f'(x)\Delta x$$
$$y+\Delta y\approx f(x)+f'(x)\Delta x$$
$$\Delta y\approx f'(x)\Delta x$$</p>

<p><i>A little history:</i> Until just $20$ or $30$ years ago,
calculators were not widely available, and especially not typically
able to evaluate trigonometric, exponential, and logarithm
functions. In that context, the kind of vague and unreliable
&lsquo;approximation&rsquo; furnished by &lsquo;differentials&rsquo; was certainly worthwhile
in many situations.</p>

<p>By contrast, now that pretty sophisticated calculators are widely
available, some things that once seemed sensible are no longer. For
example, a very traditional type of question is to &lsquo;approximate
$\sqrt{10}$ by differentials&rsquo;. A reasonable contemporary response
would be to simply punch in &lsquo;$1,0,\sqrt{}$&rsquo; on your calculator and get
the answer immediately to 10 decimal places. But this was possible
only relatively recently.</p>


<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>For example let's approximate $\sqrt{17}$ by
differentials. For this problem to make sense at all <i>imagine that
you have no calculator</i>. We take $f(x)=\sqrt{x}=x^{1/2}$. <i>The idea
here is that we can  easily evaluate &lsquo;by hand&rsquo; both $f$ and $f'$
at the point $x=16$ which is &lsquo;near&rsquo; $17$</i>. (Here
$f'(x)={1\over 2}x^{-1/2}$). Thus, here
$$\Delta x=17-16=1$$
and
$$\sqrt{17}=f(17)\approx f(16)+f'(16)\Delta
x=\sqrt{16}+{1\over 2}{ 1 \over \sqrt{16 }}\cdot 1=4+{1\over 8}$$</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Similarly, if we wanted to approximate $\sqrt{18}$ &lsquo;by
differentials&rsquo;, we'd again take $f(x)=\sqrt{x}=x^{1/2}$. Still we
imagine that we are doing this &lsquo;by hand&rsquo;, and then of course we can
&lsquo;easily evaluate&rsquo; the function $f$ and its derivative $f'$ at the point $x=16$ which is &lsquo;near&rsquo; $18$. Thus, here
$$\Delta x=18-16=2$$
and
$$\sqrt{18}=f(18)\approx f(16)+f'(16)\Delta
x=\sqrt{16}+{1\over 2}{ 1 \over \sqrt{16 }}\cdot 2=4+{1\over 4}.$$</p>

<p>Why not use the &lsquo;good&rsquo; point $25$ as the &lsquo;nearby&rsquo; point to
find $\sqrt{18}$? Well, in broad terms, the further away your &lsquo;good&rsquo;
point is, the worse the approximation will be. Yes, it is true that we
have little idea how good or bad the approximation is <i>anyway</i>.</p>

<p>It is somewhat more sensible to <i>not</i> use this idea for
numerical work, but rather to say things like $$\sqrt{x+1}\approx
\sqrt{x}+{1\over 2}{ 1 \over \sqrt{x }}$$ and $$\sqrt{x+h}\approx
\sqrt{x}+{1\over 2}{ 1 \over \sqrt{x }}\cdot h.$$ This kind of assertion
is more than any particular numerical example would give, because it
gives a <i>relationship</i>, telling how much the <i>output</i> changes
for given change in <i>input</i>, depending what <i>regime</i>
(=interval) the input is generally in. In this example, we can make
the <i>qualitative</i> observation that <i>as $x$ increases the
difference $\sqrt{x+1}-\sqrt{x}$ decreases</i>.</p>

<h4>Example 3</h4>

<p>Another numerical example: Approximate $\sin\,31^o$ &lsquo;by
differentials&rsquo;. Again, the point is <i>not</i> to hit $3,1,\sin$ on
your calculator (after switching to degrees), but rather to <i>
imagine that you have no calculator</i>. And we are supposed to remember
from pre-calculator days the &lsquo;special angles&rsquo; and the values of trig
functions at them: $\sin \,30^o={1\over 2}$ and $\cos
\,30^o={\sqrt{3} \over 2}$. So we'd use the function $f(x)=\sin\,x$,
and we'd imagine that we can evaluate $f$ and $f'$ easily by hand at
$30^o$. Then
$$\Delta x=31^o-30^o=1^o=1^o\cdot {2\pi\hbox{ radians } \over 360^o}=
 {2\pi\over 360}\hbox{ radians }$$ 
We have to rewrite things in radians
since we really only can compute derivatives of trig functions in
radians. Yes, this is a complication in our supposed &lsquo;computation by
hand&rsquo;. Anyway, we have 
$$\sin\,31^o=f(31^o)=f(30^o)+f'(30^o)\Delta
x =\sin\,30^o+\cos\,30^o\cdot {2\pi\over 360}$$
$$={1\over 2}+{\sqrt{3} \over 2} {2\pi\over 360}$$ Evidently we are
to <i>also</i> imagine that we <i>know</i> or can easily <i>find</i>
$\sqrt{3}$ (by differentials?) as well as a value of $\pi$. <i>Yes</i>,
this is a lot of trouble in comparison to just punching the
buttons, and from a contemporary perspective may seem senseless.</p>

<h4>Example 4</h4>
<p>Approximate $\ln(x+2)$  &lsquo;by differentials&rsquo;, in terms of
$\ln x$ and $x$: This <i>non-numerical</i> question is somewhat more
sensible. Take $f(x)=\ln\,x$, so that $f'(x)={1\over x}$. Then
$$\Delta x=(x+2)-x=2$$
and by the formulas above
$$\ln(x+2)=f(x+2)\approx f(x)+f'(x)\cdot 2=\ln\,x+{2\over x}.$$</p>

<h4>Example 5</h4>
<p>Approximate $\ln\,(e+2)$ in terms of differentials: Use
$f(x)=\ln\,x$ again, so $f'(x)={1\over x}$. We probably have to
imagine that we can &lsquo;easily evaluate&rsquo; both $\ln\,x$ and ${1\over x}$
at $x=e$. (Do we know a numerical approximation to $e$?). Now 
$$\Delta x = (e+2)-e = 2$$
so we have
$$\ln(e+2)=f(e+2)\approx f(e)+f'(e)\cdot 2=\ln\,e+{2\over e}=1+{2\over e}$$
since $\ln\,e=1$.</p>
