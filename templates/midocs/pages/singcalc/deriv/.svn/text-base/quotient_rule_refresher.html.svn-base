{% title "A refresher on the quotient rule" %}
{% description "How to compute the derivative of a quotient." %}

<p>The quotient rule is one of the more irritating and goofy things in
elementary calculus, but it just couldn't have been any other way. The
general principle is
$${d\over dx}\left({f\over g}\right)={f'g-g'f\over g^2}$$
The main hazard is remembering that the numerator is as it is, rather
than accidentally reversing the roles of $f$ and $g$, and then being
off by $\pm$, which could be fatal in real life.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:
\begin{align*}
{d\over dx}\left({1\over x-2}\right) &amp;=
{{d\over dx}1\cdot(x-2)-1\cdot{d\over dx}(x-2) \over (x-2)^2}=
{0\cdot (x-2)-1\cdot 1\over (x-2)^2}={-1\over (x-2)^2}\\
{d\over dx}\left({x-1\over x-2}\right)&amp;=
{(x-1)'(x-2)-(x-1)(x-2)'\over (x-2)^2}=
{1\cdot(x-2)-(x-1)\cdot 1\over (x-2)^2}\\
&amp;=
{(x-2)-(x-1)\over (x-2)^2}=
{-1\over (x-2)^2}\\
{d\over dx}\left({5x^3+x\over 2-x^7}\right)&amp;=
{(5x^3+x)'\cdot(2-x^7)-(5x^3+x)\cdot(2-x^7)\over (2-x^7)^2}\\
&amp;=
{(15x^2+1)\cdot(2-x^7)-(5x^3+x)\cdot(-7x^6)\over (2-x^7)^2}
\end{align*}
There's hardly any point in simplifying the last expression,
unless someone gives you a good reason. In general, it's not so easy
to see how much may or may not be gained in &lsquo;simplifying&rsquo;, and we
won't make ourselves crazy over it.</p>
