{% description "Finding points where the second derivative changes sign." %}

<p>A <b>point of inflection</b> of the graph of a function $f$ is a point
where the <i>second</i> derivative $f''$ is $0$. We have to wait a
minute to clarify the geometric meaning of this.</p>

<p>A piece of the graph of $f$ is <b>concave upward</b> if the curve
&lsquo;bends&rsquo; upward. For example, the popular parabola $y=x^2$ is concave
upward in its entirety.</p>

<p>A piece of the graph of $f$ is <b>concave downward</b> if the curve
&lsquo;bends&rsquo; downward. For example, a &lsquo;flipped&rsquo; version $y=-x^2$ of the
popular parabola is concave downward in its entirety.</p>

<p>The relation of <i>points of inflection</i> to <i>intervals where the
curve is concave up or down</i> is exactly the same as the relation of
<i>critical points</i> to <i>intervals where the function is
increasing or decreasing</i>. That is, the points of inflection mark the
boundaries of the two different sort of behavior. Further, only one
sample value of $f''$ need be taken between each pair of consecutive
inflection points in order to see whether the curve bends up or down
along that interval.</p>

<p class="pre_list">Expressing this as a systematic procedure: <i>to find the intervals
along which $f$ is concave upward and concave downward:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Compute the <i>second</i> derivative $f''$ of $f$, and <i>
solve</i> the equation $f''(x)=0$ for $x$ to find all the inflection
points, which we list in order as $x_1
< x_2 <\ldots < x_n$. (Any points of
discontinuity, etc., should be added to the list!)</li>
<li>We need some <i>auxiliary points</i>: To the left of the leftmost
inflection point $x_1$ pick any convenient point $t_o$, between each pair of
consecutive inflection points $x_i,x_{i+1}$ choose any convenient point
$t_i$, and to the right of the rightmost inflection point $x_n$ choose a
convenient point $t_n$. </li>
<li>Evaluate the <i>second derivative</i> $f''$ at all the <i>auxiliary</i>
points $t_i$. </li>
<li>Conclusion: if $f''(t_{i+1})>0$, then $f$ is <i>concave
upward</i> on $(x_i,x_{i+1})$, while if $f''(t_{i+1}) < 0$, then $f$ is <i>concave downward</i> on that interval.</li>
<li>Conclusion: on the &lsquo;outside&rsquo; interval $(-\infty,x_o)$, the
function $f$ is <i>concave upward</i> if $f''(t_o)>0$ and is <i>concave downward</i> if $f''(t_o) < 0$. Similarly, on $(x_n,\infty)$, the
function $f$ is <i>concave upward</i> if $f''(t_n)>0$ and is <i>concave downward</i> if $f''(t_n) < 0$.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>Find the inflection points and intervals of concavity up
and down of 
$$f(x)=3x^2-9x+6$$ First, the second derivative is just
$f''(x)=6$.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b> Since this is never zero, there are <i>not</i> points of
inflection. And the value of $f''$ is always $6$, so is always $>0$,
so the curve is entirely <i>concave upward</i>.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Find the inflection points and intervals of concavity up
and down of 
$$f(x)=2x^3-12x^2+4x-27.$$ </p>

<p><b>Solution:</b>
First, the second derivative is
$f''(x)=12x-24$. Thus, solving $12x-24=0$, there is just the one
inflection point, $2$. Choose auxiliary points $t_o=0$ to the left
of the inflection point and $t_1=3$ to the right of the inflection
point. Then $f''(0)=-24<0$, so on $(-\infty,2)$ the curve is concave
<i>downward</i>. And $f''(2)=12>0$, so on $(2,\infty)$ the curve is concave
<i>upward</i>.</p>

<h4>Example 3</h4>

<p>Find the inflection points and intervals of concavity up
and down of 
$$f(x)=x^4-24x^2+11.$$ </p>

<p><b>Solution:</b>
The second derivative is 
$f''(x)=12x^2-48$. Solving the equation $12x^2-48=0$, we find
inflection points $\pm 2$. Choosing auxiliary points $-3,0,3$ placed
between and to the left and right of the inflection points, we
evaluate the second derivative: First, $f''(-3)=12\cdot 9-48>0$, so the curve
is concave <i>upward</i> on $(-\infty,-2)$. Second, $f''(0)=-48
<0$, so
the curve is concave <i>downward</i> on $(-2,2)$. Third, 
$f''(3)=12\cdot 9-48>0$, so the curve
is concave <i>upward</i> on $(2,\infty)$.</p>
