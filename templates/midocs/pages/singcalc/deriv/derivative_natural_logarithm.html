<p>The {% intlink "exploring_derivative_exponential_function" %}derivative of the exponential function{%endintlink%} $f(x)=e^x$ is the function itself: $f'(x)=e^x$.  The natural logarithm $\ln(y)$ is the {% intlink "inverse_function_definition" %}inverse{%endintlink%} of the exponential function.  Can we exploit this fact to determine the derivative of the natural logarithm?  Here we present a version of the {% intlink "derivative_inverse_function" %}derivative of an inverse function page{%endintlink%} that is specialized to the natural logarithm.</p>

<p>To determine how to compute the derivative of the inverse of $f$, let's think about the derivative of $f$ in terms of the {% intlink "function_machine" %}function machine metaphor{%endintlink%}.</p>

{% image "function_machine_f" %}

<p>We have denoted the input of $f$ (the tetrahedron) by the variable $x$.  Let's denote the output of $f$ (the sphere) by the variable $y$ so that
$$y=f(x) = e^x.$$
Since the derivative of $f$ is the ratio of the change in its output to the change in its input, we can write the derivative as
\begin{align*}
  \diff{f}{x}&=\frac{\text{change in output of $f$}}{\text{change in input to $f$}}\\
  &= \frac{\text{change in $y$}}{\text{change in $x$}}\\
  &=e^x.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>Can we do the same thing for the inverse of $f$?  Let's use a {% intlink "function_machine_inverse" %}function machine to represent the inverse{%endintlink%} of $f$.</p>

{% image "function_machine_finv" %}

<p>We denote the inverse of $f$ by $f^{-1}$ (pronounced &ldquo;f inverse&rdquo;).  The input to $f^{-1}$ is the output of $f$ (the sphere), which we have labeled as $y$. The output of $f^{-1}$ is the input to $f$ (the tetrahedron), which we have labeled as $x$.  Since the natural logarithm is the inverse of the exponential function, we can write $f^{-1}$ as
$$x=f^{-1}(y) = \ln(y).$$
</p>

<p>We can represent the derivative of $f^{-1}$ in the same was as we did for $f$.  Using that the derivative of $f^{-1}$ is the ratio of the change in its output to the change in its input, we can conclude that 
\begin{align*}
  \diff{f^{-1}}{y} &=\frac{\text{change in output of $f^{-1}$}}{\text{change in input to $f^{-1}$}}\\
  &=\frac{\text{change in input to $f$}}{\text{change in output of $f$}}\\
  &= \frac{\text{change in $x$}}{\text{change in $y$}}.
\end{align*}
In other words, the derivative of $f^{-1}$ is the reciprocal of the derivative of $f$.  Since $f'(x)=e^x$, the derivative of $f^{-1}(y)$ must be $1/e^{x}$.  However, since $f^{-1}(y)$ is a function of $y$ (the sphere) not of $x$ (the tetrahedron), we need to rewrite the derivative of $f^{-1}$ in terms of $y$.  Since $y=e^{x}$, the derivative of $f^{-1}$ is $1/e^{x}=1/y$, i.e.,
\begin{align*}
  \diff{f^{-1}}{y} &= \diff{}{y} \ln(y)\\
  &= \frac{1}{y}.
\end{align*}
