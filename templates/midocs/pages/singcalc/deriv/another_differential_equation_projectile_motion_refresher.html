<p>Here we encounter the fundamental idea that <i>if $s=s(t)$ is
position, then $\dot{s}$ is velocity, and $\ddot{s}$ is
acceleration.</i> This idea occurs in all basic physical science and
engineering.</p>

<p>In particular, for a projectile near the earth's surface
travelling straight up and down, ignoring air resistance, acted upon
by no other forces but <i>gravity</i>, we have 
$$\hbox{ acceleration due to gravity }= -32 \hbox{ feet/sec }^2.$$ 
Thus, letting $s(t)$ be position at time $t$, we have
$$\ddot{s}(t)=-32.$$ We take this (approximate) <i>physical fact</i> as
our starting point. </p>

<p>From $\ddot{s}=-32$ we <i>integrate</i> (or <i>anti-differentiate</i>) once to undo one of the 
derivatives, getting back to <i>velocity</i>:
$$v(t)=\dot{s}=\dot{s}(t)=-32t+v_o$$
where we are calling the <i>constant of integration</i>
&lsquo;$v_o$&rsquo;. (No matter which constant $v_o$ we might take, the derivative
of $-32t+v_o$ with respect to $t$ is $-32$.)</p>

<p>Specifically, when $t=0$, we have
$$v(0)=v_o$$
Thus, the constant of integration $v_o$ is <b>initial velocity</b>. And
we have this formula for the velocity at <i>any</i> time in terms of
<i>initial</i> velocity.</p>

<p>We integrate once more to undo the last derivative, getting
back to the <i>position</i> function itself:
$$s=s(t)=-16t^2+v_ot+s_o$$
where we are calling the constant of integration
&lsquo;$s_o$&rsquo;. Specifically, when $t=0$, we have
$$s(0)=s_o$$
so $s_o$ is <b>initial position</b>. Thus, we have a formula for
position at <i>any</i> time in terms of <i>initial position</i> and <i>initial velocity</i>.</p>

<p>Of course, in many problems the data we are given is <i>not</i> just the initial position and initial velocity, but something
else, so we have to determine these constants indirectly.</p>
