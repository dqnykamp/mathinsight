<p>First we can tell what the <i>idea</i> of a derivative is. But the
issue of <i>computing</i> derivatives is another thing entirely: a
person can understand the <i>idea</i> without being able to effectively
<i>compute</i>, and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Suppose that $f$ is a function of interest for some reason. We can
give $f$ some sort of &lsquo;geometric life&rsquo; by thinking about <i>the set
of points $(x,y)$ so that</i>
$$f(x)=y$$
We would say that this describes a <i>curve</i> in the $(x,y)$-plane.
(And sometimes we think of $x$ as &lsquo;moving&rsquo; from left to right,
imparting further intuitive or physical content to the story).</p>

<p>For some particular number $x_o$, let $y_o$ be the value
$f(x_o)$ obtained as output by plugging $x_o$ into $f$ as input. Then
the point $(x_o,y_o)$ is a point on our curve. The <b>tangent line</b>
to the curve <b>at</b> the point $(x_o,y_o)$ is a line passing through
$(x_o,y_o)$ and &lsquo;flat against&rsquo; the curve. (As opposed to <i>crossing
it at some definite angle</i>).</p>

<p>The <i>idea</i> of the derivative $f'(x_o)$ is that it is <i>the slope of the tangent line</i> at $x_o$ to the curve. But this isn't
the way to <i>compute</i> these things...</p>
