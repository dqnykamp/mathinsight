{% description "A method to approximate the roots to an equation." %}

<p>This is a method which, once you get started, quickly gives a very
good approximation to a root of polynomial (and other) equations.  The
idea is that, if $x_o$ is <i>not</i> a root of a polynomial equation,
but is pretty close to a root, then <i>sliding down the tangent line
at $x_o$ to the graph of $f$ gives a good approximation to the actual
root</i>. The point is that this process can be repeated as much as
necessary to give as good an approximation as you want.</p>

<p>Let's derive the relevant formula: if our blind guess for a root of
$f$ is $x_o$, then the tangent line is
$$y-f(x_o)=f'(x_o)(x-x_o)$$
&lsquo;Sliding down&rsquo; the tangent line to hit the $x$-axis means to find the
intersection of this line with the $x$-axis: this is where
$y=0$. Thus, we solve for $x$ in
$$0-f(x_o)=f'(x_o)(x-x_o)$$
to find
$$x=x_o-{f(x_o)\over f'(x_o)}$$</p>

<p>Well, let's call this <i>first serious guess</i> $x_1$. Then, repeating this
process, the <i>second serious guess</i> would be
$$x_2=x_1-{f(x_1)\over f'(x_1)}$$
and generally, if we have the $n$th guess $x_n$ then the $n+1$th guess
$x_{n+1}$ is
$$x_{n+1}=x_n-{f(x_n)\over f'(x_n)}$$</p>

<p>OK, that's the formula for <i>improving our guesses</i>. How do we
decide when to quit? Well, it depends upon to how many decimal places we
want our approximation to be good. Basically, if we want, for example,
$3$ decimal places accuracy, then as soon as $x_n$ and $x_{n+1}$ <i>agree</i> to three decimal places, we can presume that those are the <i>true</i> decimals of the true root of the equation. This will be
illustrated in the examples below.</p>

<p>It is important to realize that there is some uncertainty in Newton's
method, both because it alone cannot assure that we have a root, and
also because the idea just described for approximating roots to a
given accuracy is not foolproof. But to worry about what could go
wrong here is counter-productive.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>Approximate a root of $x^3-x+1=0$ using the
{% intlink intermediate_value_theorem_location_roots_refresher %}intermediate value theorem{%endintlink%} to get started, and then Newton's method:</p>

<p>First let's see what happens if we are a little foolish here,
in terms of the &lsquo;blind&rsquo; guess we start with. If we ignore the advice
about using the intermediate value theorem to <i>guarantee</i> a root
in some known interval, we'll waste time. Let's see: The
general formula $$x_{n+1}=x_n-{f(x_n)\over f'(x_n)}$$ becomes
$$x_{n+1}=x_n-{x^3-x+1\over 3x^2-1}$$ If we take $x_1=1$ as our
&lsquo;blind&rsquo; guess, then plugging into the formula gives 
$$x_2=0.5$$
$$x_3=3$$ 
$$x_4=2.0384615384615383249$$ 
This is discouraging,
since the numbers are jumping around somewhat. But if we are stubborn
and can compute
quickly with a calculator (not by hand!), we'd see what happens:
$$\matrix{
x_5&amp;=&amp;1.3902821472167361527 \cr 
x_6&amp;=&amp;0.9116118977179270555\cr 
x_7&amp;=&amp;0.34502849674816926662 \cr 
x_8&amp;=&amp;1.4277507040272707783\cr 
x_9&amp;=&amp;0.94241791250948314662 \cr 
x_{10}&amp;=&amp;0.40494935719938018881\cr 
x_{11}&amp;=&amp;1.7069046451828553401 \cr 
x_{12}&amp;=&amp;1.1557563610748160521\cr 
x_{13}&amp;=&amp;0.69419181332954971175 \cr 
x_{14}&amp;=&amp;-0.74249429872066285974\cr 
x_{15}&amp;=&amp;-2.7812959406781381233 \cr 
x_{16}&amp;=&amp;-1.9827252470441485421\cr 
x_{17}&amp;=&amp;-1.5369273797584126484 \cr 
x_{18}&amp;=&amp;-1.3572624831877750928\cr 
x_{19}&amp;=&amp;-1.3256630944288703144 \cr 
x_{20}&amp;=&amp;-1.324718788615257159\cr 
x_{21}&amp;=&amp;-1.3247179572453899876
}$$</p>

<p>Well, after quite a few iterations of &lsquo;sliding down the tangent&rsquo;, the
last two numbers we got, $x_{20}$ and $x_{21}$, agree to $5$ decimal
places. This would make us think that the <i>true</i> root is <i>approximated to five decimal places</i> by $-1.32471$.</p>

<p>The stupid aspect of this little scenario was that our initial &lsquo;blind&rsquo;
guess was <i>too far from an actual root</i>, so that there was some
wacky jumping around of the numbers before things settled down. If we
had been computing by hand this would have been hopeless.</p>

<p>Let's try this example again using the Intermediate Value Theorem to
pin down a root with some degree of accuracy: First, $f(1)=1>0$. Then
$f(0)=+1>0$ also, so we might <i>doubt</i> that there is a root in
$[0,1]$.  Continue: $f(-1)=1>0$ again, so we might <i>doubt</i> that
there is a root in $[-1,0]$, either. Continue: at last $f(-2)=-5 < 0$,
so since $f(-1)>0$ by the Intermediate Value Theorem we do indeed know
that there is a root between $-2$ and $-1$. Now to start using <i>Newton's Method</i>, we would reasonably guess
$$x_o=-1.5$$
since this is the midpoint of the interval on which we know there is a
root. Then computing by Newton's method gives:
$$
\matrix{
x_{1}&amp;=&amp;-1.3478260869565217295\cr 
x_{2}&amp;=&amp;-1.3252003989509069104\cr 
x_{3}&amp;=&amp;-1.324718173999053672\cr 
x_{4}&amp;=&amp;-1.3247179572447898011
}$$
so right away we have what appears to be $5$ decimal places accuracy,
in $4$ steps rather than $21$. Getting off to a good start is important.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Approximate <i>all three</i> roots of $x^3-3x+1=0$ using the
intermediate value theorem to get started, and then Newton's
method. Here you have to take a little care in choice of beginning
&lsquo;guess&rsquo; for Newton's method:</p>

<p>In this case, since we are <i>told</i> that there are three
roots, then we should certainly be wary about where we start:
presumably we have to start in different places in order to
successfully use Newton's method to find the different roots. So,
starting thinking in terms of the intermediate value theorem: letting
$f(x)=x^3-3x+1$, we have $f(2)=3>0$. Next, $f(1)=-1 < 0$, so we by the
Intermediate Value Theorem we know there is a root in $[1,2]$. Let's
try to approximate it pretty well before looking for the other roots:
The general formula for Newton's method becomes
$$x_{n+1}=x_n-{x^3-3x+1\over 3x^2-3}$$
Our initial &lsquo;blind&rsquo; guess might reasonably be the midpoint of the
interval in which we know there is a root: take 
$$x_o=1.5$$
Then we can compute
$$\matrix{
x_{1}&amp;=&amp;1.533333333333333437\cr 
x_{2}&amp;=&amp;1.5320906432748537807\cr 
x_{3}&amp;=&amp;1.5320888862414665521\cr 
x_{4}&amp;=&amp;1.5320888862379560269\cr 
x_{5}&amp;=&amp;1.5320888862379560269\cr 
x_{6}&amp;=&amp;1.5320888862379560269
}$$
So it appears that we have quickly approximated a root in that
interval! To what looks like $19$ decimal places!</p>

<p>Continuing with this example: $f(0)=1>0$, so since $f(1) < 0$
we know by the intermediate value theorem that there is a root in
$[0,1]$, since $f(1)=-1 < 0$. So as our blind gues let's use the
midpoint of this interval to start Newton's Method: that is, now take
$x_o=0.5$:
$$\matrix{
x_{1}&amp;=&amp;0.33333333333333337034\cr 
x_{2}&amp;=&amp;0.3472222222222222654\cr 
x_{3}&amp;=&amp;0.34729635316386797683\cr 
x_{4}&amp;=&amp;0.34729635533386071788\cr 
x_{5}&amp;=&amp;0.34729635533386060686\cr 
x_{6}&amp;=&amp;0.34729635533386071788\cr 
x_{7}&amp;=&amp;0.34729635533386060686\cr 
x_{8}&amp;=&amp;0.34729635533386071788
}$$
so we have a root evidently approximated to $3$ decimal places after
just $2$ applications of Newton's method. After $8$ applications, we
have apparently $15$ correct decimal places.</p>
