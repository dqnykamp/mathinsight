{% title "Local minima and maxima (First Derivative Test)" %}
{% description "How to calculate the local maxima and minima of a differentiable function." %}


<p>A function $f$ has a <b>local maximum</b> or <b>relative maximum</b> at
a point $x_o$ if the values $f(x)$ of $f$ for $x$ &lsquo;near&rsquo; $x_o$ are all
less than $f(x_o)$. Thus, the graph of $f$ near $x_o$ has a <i>peak</i>
at $x_o$.
A function $f$ has a <b>local minimum</b> or <b>relative minimum</b> at
a point $x_o$ if the values $f(x)$ of $f$ for $x$ &lsquo;near&rsquo; $x_o$ are all
greater than $f(x_o)$. Thus, the graph of $f$ near $x_o$ has a <i>trough</i> at $x_o$.
(To make the distinction clear, sometimes the &lsquo;plain&rsquo; maximum and
minimum are called <b>absolute</b> maximum and minimum.)</p>

<p>Yes, in both these &lsquo;definitions&rsquo; we are tolerating ambiguity about
what &lsquo;near&rsquo; would mean, although the peak/trough requirement on the
graph could be translated into a less ambiguous definition. But in any
case we'll be able to execute the procedure given below to <i>find</i>
local maxima and minima without worrying over a formal definition.</p>

<p><i>This procedure is just a variant of things we've already done to
{% intlink minimization_maximization_refresher%}analyze the intervals of increase and decrease of a function{%endintlink%}, or to
find absolute maxima and minima.</i> This procedure starts out the same
way as does the analysis of intervals of increase/decrease, and also
the procedure for finding (&lsquo;absolute&rsquo;) maxima and minima of functions.</p>

<p class="pre_list">To find the local maxima and minima of a function $f$ on an interval
$[a,b]$:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solve $f'(x)=0$ to find <i>{% intlink critical_points_monotone_increase_decrease_refresher %}critical points{%endintlink%}</i> of
$f$.</li>
<li>Drop from the list any critical points that aren't in the
interval $[a,b]$.</li>
<li>Add to the list the endpoints (and any points of discontinuity
or non-differentiability): we have an <i>ordered</i> list of special
points in the interval:
$$a=x_o
< x_1
< \ldots
< x_n=b$$</li>
<li>Between each pair $x_i
< x_{i+1}$ of points in the list, choose an
auxiliary point $t_{i+1}$. Evaluate the <i>derivative</i> $f'$ at all
the auxiliary points.</li>
<li>For each critical point $x_i$, we have the auxiliary points to
each side of it: $t_i < x_i < t_{i+1}$. There are four cases <i>best
remembered by drawing a picture!</i>:</li>
<li>if $f'(t_i)>0$ and $f'(t_{i+1}) < 0$ (so $f$ is <i>increasing</i>
to the left of $x_i$ and <i>decreasing</i> to the right of $x_i$, then
$f$ has a <i>local maximum</i> at $x_o$.</li>
<li>if $f'(t_i) < 0$ and $f'(t_{i+1})>0$ (so $f$ is <i>decreasing</i>
to the left of $x_i$ and <i>increasing</i> to the right of $x_i$, then
$f$ has a <i>local minimum</i> at $x_o$.</li>
<li>if $f'(t_i) < 0$ and $f'(t_{i+1}) <0 $ (so $f$ is <i>decreasing</i>
to the left of $x_i$ and <i>also decreasing</i> to the right of $x_i$, then
$f$ has <i>neither</i> a local maximum nor a local minimum at $x_o$.</li>
<li>if $f'(t_i)>0$ and $f'(t_{i+1})>0$ (so $f$ is <i>increasing</i>
to the left of $x_i$ and <i>also increasing</i> to the right of $x_i$, then
$f$ has <i>neither</i> a local maximum nor a local minimum at $x_o$.</li>
</ul>

<p class="pre_list">The endpoints require separate treatment: There is the auxiliary
point $t_o$ just to the <i>right</i> of the left endpoint $a$, and the
auxiliary point $t_n$ just to the <i>left</i> of the right endpoint $b$:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the <i>left</i> endpoint $a$, if $f'(t_o) < 0$ (so $f'$ is <i>decreasing</i> to the right of $a$) then $a$ is a <i>local maximum</i>.</li>
<li>At the <i>left</i> endpoint $a$, if $f'(t_o)>0$ (so $f'$ is <i>increasing</i> to the right of $a$) then $a$ is a <i>local minimum</i>.</li>
<li>At the <i>right</i> endpoint $b$, if $f'(t_n) < 0$ (so $f'$ is <i>decreasing</i> as $b$ is approached from the left) then $b$ is a <i>local minimum</i>.</li>
<li>At the <i>right</i> endpoint $b$, if $f'(t_n)> 0$ (so $f'$ is <i>increasing</i> as $b$ is approached from the left) then $b$ is a <i>local maximum</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The possibly bewildering list of possibilities really
shouldn't be bewildering after you get used to them. We are already
acquainted with evaluation of $f'$ at auxiliary points between
critical points in order to see whether the function is increasing or
decreasing, and now we're just applying that information to see
whether the graph <i>peaks, troughs, or does neither</i> around each
critical point and endpoints. That is, <i>the geometric meaning of the
derivative's being positive or negative is easily translated into
conclusions about local maxima or minima.</i></p>

<p>Find all the local (=relative) minima and maxima of the
function $f(x)=2x^3-9x^2+1$ on the interval $[-2,2]$: To find critical
points, solve $f'(x)=0$: this is $6x^2-18x=0$ or $x(x-3)=0$, so there
are two critical points, $0$ and $3$. Since $3$ is not in the interval
we care about, we drop it from our list. Adding the endpoints to the
list, we have $$-2 < 0< 2$$ as our ordered list of special points. Let's
use auxiliary points $-1,1$. At $-1$ the derivative is $f'(-1)=24>0$,
so the function is increasing there. At $+1$ the derivative is
$f'(1)=-12 < 0$, so the function is decreasing. Thus, since it is
increasing to the left and decreasing to the right of $0$, it must be
that $0$ is a <i>local maximum</i>. Since $f$ is increasing to the
right of the left endpoint $-2$, that left endpoint must give a <i>local minimum</i>. Since it is decreasing to the left of the right
endpoint $+2$, the right endpoint must be a <i>local minimum</i>.</p>

<p>Notice that although the processes of finding <i>absolute</i>
maxima and minima and <i>local</i> maxima and minima have a lot in
common, they have essential differences. In particular, the only
relations between them are that <i>critical points</i> and <i>endpoints</i> (and points of discontinuity, etc.) play a big role in
both, and that the <i>absolute</i> maximum is certainly a <i>local</i>
maximum, and likewise the <i>absolute</i> minimum is certainly a <i>local</i> minimum.</p>

<p>For example, just plugging critical points into the function does not
reliably indicate which points are <i>local</i> maxima and minima. And,
on the other hand, knowing which of the critical points are <i>local</i> maxima and minima generally is only a small step toward
figuring out which are <i>absolute</i>: values still have to be plugged
into the function! <i>So don't confuse the two procedures!</i></p>

<p>(By the way: while it's fairly easy to make up story-problems where the
issue is to find the maximum or minimum value of some function on some
interval, it's harder to think of a simple application of <i>local</i> maxima
or minima).</p>
