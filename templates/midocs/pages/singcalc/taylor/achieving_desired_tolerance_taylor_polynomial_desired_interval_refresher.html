<p>This {% intlink "prototypes_more_serious_questions_taylor_polynomials_refresher" %}third question{%endintlink%} is usually the most difficult, since it requires
both <i>estimates</i> and adjustment of <i>number of terms</i> in the
Taylor expansion: Given a function, given a fixed point, given
an interval around that fixed point, and given a required tolerance,
find <i>how many terms</i> must be used in the Taylor expansion to
approximate the function to within the required tolerance on the given
interval.</p>

<p>For example, let's get a Taylor polynomial approximation to
$e^x$ which is within $0.001$ on the interval
$[-{1\over 2},+{1\over 2}]$. We use
$$e^x=1+x+{x^2\over 2!}+{x^3\over 3!}+\ldots+{x^n\over n!}+
{e^c\over (n+1)!}x^{n+1}$$
for some $c$ between $0$ and $x$, and where we do not yet know what we
want $n$ to be. It is very convenient here that the $n$th derivative
of $e^x$ is still just $e^x$! We are wanting to <i>choose $n$ large-enough to guarantee that</i>
$$\left|{e^c\over (n+1)!}x^{n+1}\right|\le 0.001$$
for all $x$ in that interval (without knowing anything too detailed
about what the corresponding $c$'s are!).</p>

<p>The error term is estimated as follows,
by thinking 
about the <i>worst-case scenario</i> for the sizes of the parts of that
term: we know that the exponential function is increasing along the
whole real line, so in any event $c$ lies in
$[-{1\over 2},+{1\over 2}]$ and
$$|e^c|\le e^{1/2}\le 2$$
(where we've not been too fussy about being accurate about how big the
square root of $e$ is!). And for $x$ in that interval we know that
$$|x^{n+1}|\le \left({1\over 2}\right)^{n+1}$$
So we are wanting to <i>choose $n$ large-enough to guarantee that</i>
$$\left|{e^c\over (n+1)!} ({1\over 2})^{n+1}\right|\le 0.001$$
Since
$$\left|{e^c\over (n+1)!} ({1\over 2})^{n+1}\right|
\le {2\over (n+1)!}\left({1\over 2}\right)^{n+1}$$
we can be confident of the desired inequality if we can be sure that
$${2\over (n+1)!}\left({1\over 2}\right)^{n+1}\le 0.001$$
That is, we want to &lsquo;solve&rsquo; for $n$ in the inequality
$${2\over (n+1)!}\left({1\over 2}\right)^{n+1}\le 0.001$$</p>

<p>There is no genuine formulaic way to &lsquo;solve&rsquo; for $n$ to accomplish
this. Rather, we just evaluate the left-hand side of the desired
inequality for larger and larger values of $n$ until (hopefully!) we
get something smaller than $0.001$. So, trying $n=3$, the expression
is
$${2\over (3+1)!}\left({1\over 2}\right)^{3+1}={1\over 12\cdot 16}$$
which is more like $0.01$ than $0.001$. So just try $n=4$:
$${2\over (4+1)!}\left({1\over 2}\right)^{4+1}={1\over 60\cdot 32}\le
0.00052$$
which is better than we need.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that we needed to take the Taylor polynomial of
degree $n=4$ to achieve the desired tolerance along the whole interval
indicated. Thus, the polynomial
$$1+x+{x^2\over 2}+{x^3\over 3}+{x^4\over 4}$$
approximates $e^x$ to within $0.00052$ for $x$ in the interval 
$[-{1\over 2},{1\over 2}]$.</p>

<p>Yes, such questions can easily become very difficult. And, as
a reminder, there is no real or genuine claim that this kind of
approach to polynomial approximation is &lsquo;the best&rsquo;.</p>
