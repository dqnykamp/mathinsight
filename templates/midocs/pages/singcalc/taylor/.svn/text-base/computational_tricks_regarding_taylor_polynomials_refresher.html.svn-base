{% description "A short cut to calculating Taylor polynomials in terms of Taylor polynomials of simple functions." %}

<p>The obvious question to ask about Taylor polynomials is &lsquo;What are the
first so-many terms in the Taylor polynomial of some function expanded
at some point?&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The most straightforward way to deal with this is just to do
what is indicated by the formula: take however high order derivatives
you need and plug in. However, very often this is not at all the most
efficient.</p>

<p>Especially in a situation where we are interested in a composite
function of the form $f(x^n)$ or $f(\hbox{polynomial in }x)$ with a
&lsquo;familiar&rsquo; function $f$, there are alternatives.</p>

<p>For example, looking at $f(x)=e^{x^3}$, if we start taking
derivatives to expand this at $0$, there will be a big mess pretty
fast. On the other hand, we might start with the &lsquo;familiar&rsquo; expansion
for $e^x$ 
$$e^x=1+x+{x^2\over 2!}+{x^3\over 3!}+{e^c\over 4!}x^4$$
with some $c$ between $0$ and $x$, where our choice to cut it off
after that many terms was simply a whim. But then
replacing $x$ by $x^3$ gives
$$e^{x^3}=1+x^3+{x^6\over 2!}+{x^9\over 3!}+{e^c\over 4!}x^{12}$$
with some $c$ between $0$ and $x^3$. Yes, we need to keep track of $c$
in relation to the <i>new</i> $x$.</p>

<p>So we get a polynomial plus that funny term with the &lsquo;c&rsquo; in
it, for the remainder. Yes, this gives us a different-looking error
term, but that's fine.</p>

<p>So we obtain, with relative ease, the expansion of degree
<i>eleven</i> of this function, which would have been horrible to
obtain by repeated differentiation and direct application of the
general formula. Why &lsquo;eleven&rsquo;?: well, the error term has the $x^{12}$
in it, which means that the polynomial itself stopped with a $x^{11}$
term. Why didn't we see that term? Well, evidently the coefficients of
$x^{11}$, and of $x^{10}$ (not to mention $x,x^2,x^4,x^5,x^7,x^8$!)
are <i>zero</i>.</p>

<p>As another example, let's get the degree-eight expansion of
$\cos x^2$ at $0$. Of course, it makes sense to use
$$\cos x=1-{x^2\over 2!}+{x^4\over 4!}+{-\sin c\over 5!}x^5$$
with $c$ between $0$ and $x$, where we note that $-\sin x$ is the
fifth derivative of $\cos x$. Replacing $x$ by $x^2$, this becomes
$$\cos x^2=1-{x^4\over 2!}+{x^8\over 4!}+{-\sin c\over 5!}x^{10}$$
where now we say that $c$ is between $0$ and $x^2$.</p>
