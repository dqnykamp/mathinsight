{% description "An example showing how to integrate a Taylor polynomial and interpret the result." %}

<p>Thinking simultaneously about the difficulty (or impossibility) of
&lsquo;direct&rsquo; symbolic integration of complicated expressions, by contrast to
the ease of integration of <i>polynomials</i>, we might hope to get
some mileage out of <i>integrating Taylor polynomials</i>.</p>

<p>As a promising example: on one hand, it's not too hard to
compute that
$$\int_0^{T} {dx\over 1-x}\;dx=[-\log (1-x)]_0^T=-\log(1-T)$$
On the other hand, if we write out
$${1\over 1-x}=1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+\ldots$$
then we could obtain
$$\int_0^{T}
(1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+\ldots)\;dx=[x+{x^2\over 2}+{x^3\over 3}+\ldots]_0^T=$$
$$ = T+{T^2\over 2}+{T^3\over 3}+{T^4\over 4}+\ldots$$
Putting these two together (and changing the variable back to &lsquo;$x$&rsquo;) gives
$$-\log(1-x)= x+{x^2\over 2}+{x^3\over 3}+{x^4\over 4}+\ldots$$</p>

<p>(For the moment let's not worry about what happens to the
error term for the Taylor polynomial).</p>

<p>This little computation has several useful
interpretations. First, we obtained a Taylor polynomial for
$-\log(1-T)$ from that of a geometric series, without going to the
trouble of recomputing derivatives. Second, from a different
perspective, we have an expression for the integral
$$\int_0^{T} {dx\over 1-x}\;dx$$
without necessarily mentioning the logarithm: that is, with some
suitable interpretation of the trailing dots,
$$\int_0^{T} {dx\over 1-x}\;dx= 
T+{T^2\over 2}+{T^3\over 3}+{T^4\over 4}+\ldots$$</p>
