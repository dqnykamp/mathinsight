{% title "How large an interval with given tolerance for a Taylor polynomial?" %}
{% description "Given a Taylor polynomial expanded around a point, on how large an interval around the point does it achieve a required tolerance?" %}

<p>This page treats a simple example of the first kind of question
mentioned on {% intlink prototypes_more_serious_questions_taylor_polynomials_refresher%}a previous page{%endintlink%}:
&lsquo;Given a Taylor polynomial
approximation to a function, expanded at some given point, and given a
required tolerance, <i>on how large an interval</i> around the given point
does the Taylor polynomial achieve that tolerance?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The specific example we'll get to here is <i>&lsquo;For what range of
$x\ge 25$ does $5+{1\over 10}(x-25)$ approximate $\sqrt{x}$ to
within $.001$?&rsquo;</i></p>

<p>Again, with the degree-one Taylor polynomial and
corresponding remainder term, for reasonable functions $f$ we have
$$f(x)=f(x_o)+f'(x_o)(x-x_o)+{f''(c)\over 2!}(x-x_o)^2$$
for some $c$ between $x_o$ and $x$. The
<b>remainder</b> term is
$$\hbox{remainder term }= {f''(c)\over 2!}(x-x_o)^2$$
The notation $2!$ means &lsquo;$2$-factorial&rsquo;, which is just $2$, but which
we write to be &lsquo;forward compatible&rsquo; with other things later.</p>

<p><i>Again: no, we do not know what $c$ is, except that it is between $x_o$
and $x$</i>. But this is entirely reasonable, since if we really knew it
exactly then we'd be able to evaluate $f(x)$ exactly and we are
evidently presuming that this isn't possible (or we wouldn't be doing
all this!). That is, we have <i>limited information</i> about what $c$
is, which we could view as the limitation on how precisely we can know
the value $f(x)$.</p>

<p>To give an example of how to use this limited information,
consider $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ (yet again!). Taking $x_o=25$, we have
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{x}&amp;=f(x)=f(x_o)+f'(x_o)(x-x_o)+{f''(c)\over 2!}(x-x_o)^2\\
&amp;=\sqrt{25}+{1\over 2} { 1 \over \sqrt{25 }}(x-25)-
{1\over 2!}{1\over 4}{ 1 \over (c)^{3/2 }}(x-25)^2\\
&amp;=5+{1\over 10}(x-25)-{1\over 8}{ 1 \over c^{3/2 }}(x-25)^2
\end{align*}
where all we know about $c$ is that it is between $25$ and $x$. What
can we expect to get from this?</p>

<p>Well, we have to make a choice or two to get started: let's suppose
that $x\ge 25$ (rather than smaller). Then we can write
$$25\le c\le x$$
From this, because the three-halves-power function is <i>
increasing</i>, we have
$$25^{3/2}\le c^{3/2}\le x^{3/2}$$
Taking inverses (with positive numbers) reverses the inequalities: we
have
$$25^{-3/2}\ge c^{-3/2}\ge x^{-3/2}$$
So, <i>in the worst-case scenario</i>, the value of $c^{-3/2}$ is at
most $25^{-3/2}=1/125$.</p>

<p>And we can rearrange the equation:
$$\sqrt{x}-[5+{1\over 10}(x-25)]=-{1\over 8}{ 1 \over c^{3/2 }}(x-25)^2$$
Taking absolute values <i>in order to talk about error</i>, this is
$$\left|\sqrt{x}-[5+{1\over 10}(x-25)]\right|=\left|{1\over 8}{ 1 \over c^{3/2 }}(x-25)^2\right|$$
Now let's use our <b>estimate</b> $|{ 1 \over c^{3/2 }}|\le 1/125$ to write
$$\left|\sqrt{x}-[5+{1\over 10}(x-25)]\right|\le\left|{1\over 8}{1\over 125}(x-25)^2\right|$$</p>

<p>OK, having done this simplification, <i>now</i> we can answer questions
like <i>For what range of $x\ge 25$ does $5+{1\over 10}(x-25)$
approximate $\sqrt{x}$ to within $.001$?</i> We cannot hope to tell <i>exactly</i>, but only to give a range of values of $x$ for which we <i>can</i>
be sure <i>based upon our estimate</i>. So the question becomes: solve
the inequality
$$\left|{1\over 8}{1\over 125}(x-25)^2\right|\le .001$$
(with $x\ge 25$). Multiplying out by the denominator of $8\cdot 125$
gives (by coincidence?)
$$|x-25|^2\le 1$$
so the solution is $25\le x\le 26$.</p>

<p>So we can conclude that $\sqrt{x}$ is approximated to within
$.001$ for all $x$ in the range $25\le x\le 26$. This is a
worthwhile kind of thing to be able to find out.</p>
