<p>For several reasons, the traditional way that <i>Taylor
polynomials</i> are taught gives the impression that the ideas are
inextricably linked with issues about <i>infinite series</i>. This is
not so, but every calculus book I know takes that approach.
The reasons for this systematic mistake are complicated. Anyway, we
will <i>not</i> make that mistake here, although we may
talk about infinite series later. </p>

<p>Instead of following the tradition, we will immediately talk about
Taylor polynomials, <i>without</i> first tiring ourselves over infinite
series, and <i>without</i> fooling anyone into thinking that Taylor
polynomials have the infinite series stuff as prerequisite!</p>

<p>The theoretical underpinning for these facts about Taylor
polynomials is <i>The Mean Value Theorem</i>, which itself depends upon
some fairly subtle properties of the real numbers. It asserts that,
<i>for a function $f$ differentiable on an interval $[a,b]$, there is a
point $c$ in the interior $(a,b)$ of this interval so that</i>
$$f'(c)={f(b)-f(a)\over b-a}$$</p>

<p>Note that the latter expression is the formula for the slope
of the &lsquo;chord&rsquo; or &lsquo;secant&rsquo; line connecting the two points $(a,f(a))$
and $(b,f(b))$ on the graph of $f$. And the $f'(c)$ can be interpreted
as the slope of the <i>tangent</i> line to the curve at the point
$(c,f(c))$.</p>

<p>In many traditional scenarios a person is expected to commit
the statement of the Mean Value Theorem to memory. And be able to
respond to issues like &lsquo;Find a point $c$ in the interval $[0,1]$
satisfying the conclusion of the Mean Value Theorem for the function
$f(x)=x^2$.&rsquo; This is pointless and we won't do it.</p>
