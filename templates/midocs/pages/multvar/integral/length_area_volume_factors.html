{% description "A summary of the expansion factors that arise from mappings in integrals of multivariable calculus." %}

<p>Many of the {% intlink integrals_multivariable_calculus_summary%}integrals
of multivariable calculus{%endintlink%} are integrals over mappings 
from a domain onto another set (the image). 
In line integrals over parametrized curves, for example, one integrates 
over a curve that is the image of an interval; a vector-valued function
maps the interval onto the image curve.
The functions that perform the mappings stretch or shrink parts of
the domain as they transform the domain onto the image.  
Hence, one part of calculating these integrals is accounting for
the expansions or contraction of these maps.</p>

<p>In what follows, we outline the different types of &ldquo;expansion factors&rdquo; 
that appears in the {% intlink integrals_multivariable_calculus_summary%}integrals{%endintlink%}.
There are three types of expansion factors, depending on the dimension of the
underlying integral.</p>

bunch of factors for length, area, and volume.  In many cases, these
factors adjusted for the expansion or compression by functions that

<h4>Length expansion factors</h4>

<p>One dimensional integrals are based on the familiar one-variable integral
of a function $\dlsi(t)$ from $t=a$ to $t=b$,
\begin{align*}
  \int_a^b \dlsi(t) dt.
\end{align*}
In the one-variable integral, we can think of $dt$ as being a length
measurement.  Other one-dimensional integrals will include an
&ldquo;length expansion factor&rdquo; that multiplies $dt$ in order to 
accurately account for length.</p>

<p>The one-dimensional integral of multivariable calculus is the 
line integral.  However, before dicussing line integrals, we examine
changing variables in one-dimensional integrals to show that the
&ldquo;$u$-substitution&rdquo; of one-variable calculus contains another
example of a length expansion factor.  
Both one-variable integrals under a change of variables and
line integrals are based on length-changing maps that transform
an interval to another interval or a curve.
</p>

{% navigation_tag "lengthonevar" "Length" "One-variable integrals" %}
<h5>Length when change variables in one-variable integrals</h5>

<p>The following is an attempt to tie one-variable change of variables to
multivariable change of variables.  If it is too confusing, just skip
it and move on.</p>

<p>When you perform a &ldquo;$u$-substitution&rdquo; in one-variable calculus, you are
changing variables.  To help you link one-variable $u$-substitution to
multivariable change of variables, we can write a $u$-substitution in
the same language as multivariable calculus.</p>

<p>Let's say you are given some integral $\int_a^b \dlsi(x) dx$ 
which you want to compute with a &ldquo;$u$-substitution.&rdquo;
In a $u$-substitution, you write $u$ as a function of $x$, but to make the
notation match that of a 
{%intlink double_integral_change_variables_introduction%}multivariable change
of variables{%endintlink%}, let's do the reverse and write  $x = T(u)$,
where $T$ is an invertible &ldquo;change of variables&rdquo; function.  
Then the $u$-substitution
is $u = T^{-1}(x)$, where $T^{-1}(x)$ is the inverse of $T(u)$.</p>

<p>
To perform the $u$-substitution, you replace $x$ with $T(u)$,
integrate from $T^{-1}(a)$ to $T^{-1}(b)$, and replace $dx$ with
$T'(u)du$.  In this notation, a $u$-substitution looks like:
\begin{align*}
  \int_a^b \dlsi(x) dx = \int_{T^{-1}(a)}^{T^{-1}(b)} \dlsi(T(u)) T'(u) du.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
We could go a little further and make this formula even closer to what
we write in multivariable calculus.  We could write the interval
$[a,b]$ as $I$.  The original integral $\int_a^b f(x)dx$ is over the interval $I=[a,b]$, so we
could write the integral as 
\begin{align*}
\int_I \dlsi(x) dx.  
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>If $x=T(u)$ is our change of variables, then $T$ maps an interval
$I^{*}$ in &ldquo;$u$-space&rdquo; to the interval $I$ in &ldquo;$x$-space.&rdquo;  If
$T^{-1}(b)$ is greater than $T^{-1}(a)$, then $I^*$ is the
interval $[T^{-1}(a), T^{-1}(b)]$.  Otherwise, $I^*$ is the
interval $[T^{-1}(b), T^{-1}(a)]$.  Our change of variables
formula is then
\begin{align*}
  \int_I \dlsi(x) dx = \int_{I^{ *}} \dlsi(T(u))|T'(u)|du.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>Note that in this case, the change of variables &ldquo;length expansion
factor&rdquo; is $| T'(u)|$.  We need the absolute value because of how we
defined $I^*$.  The case when $T'(u) <0$ corresponds to  $T^{-1}(b)< T^{-1}(a)$,
i.e., the case where we flipped the order of the endpoints in our definition of $I^*= [T^{-1}(b), T^{-1}(a)]$.
This flipping changes the sign of the integral; adding the absolute
value $|T'(u)|$ changes the sign back to the correct sign.</p>

<p>The length expansion factor $|T'(u)|$ indicates how much $T$ expands or contracts
$I^*$ when it maps $I^*$ onto $I$.</p>

<h5>Length in line integrals</h5>

<p>In {%intlink line_integral_scalar_function_introduction%}line integrals{%endintlink%}, a curve
$\dlc$ is parametrized by a function $\dllp(t)$, 
which maps on interval $t \in [a,b]$ onto the curve.
In this case, the
length measure on the curve is $d\als = \|\dllp\,'(t)\|dt$.  The length expansion factor
$\|\dllp\,'(t)\|$ accounts for expansion or contraction by $\dllp$
when it maps the interval $I=[a,b]$ onto $\dlc$.  Hence, the integral
of a scalar-valued function $\dlsi(\vc{x})$ is
\begin{align*}
  \dslint = \dpslint.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>For {%intlink line_integral_vector_field_introduction%}line integrals of vector fields{%endintlink%},
we integrate
$\dlsi = \dlvf \cdot \vc{T}$, where $\vc{T}$ is the unit tangent
vector of the curve:
\begin{align*}
  \vc{T} = \frac{\dllp'(t)}{\|\dllp'(t)\|}.
\end{align*}
In this case, the denominator cancels the $\|\dllp\,'(t)\|$ factor, 
\begin{align*}
  \dlint = \slint{\dlc}{\dlvf \cdot \vc{T}} =
  \dplint,
\end{align*}
but the expansion or contraction of $\dllp(t)$ is still included in the
$\dllp'(t)$ factor.</p>

{% navigation_tag "area" "Area" %}
<h4>Area expansion factors</h4>

<p>Two-dimensional integrals are based on the {%intlink double_integral_introduction%}double integral{%endintlink%}
of a function $\dlsi(x,y)$ over a planar region $\dlr$,
\begin{align*}
  \iint_\dlr \dlsi\, dA = \iint_\dlr \dlsi(x,y) \, dx\,dy.
\end{align*}
In the double integral, we can think of $dA=dx\,dy$ as being an area
measurement.  Other two-dimensional integrals will include an
&ldquo;area expansion factor&rdquo; that multiplies $dx\,dy$ in order to 
accurately account for area.</p>

<p>Both double integrals under a change of variables and surface integrals
involve area-changing maps of a planar region onto another
planar region or surface.  To correctly compute these integrals,
one must account for how the maps change area.</p>

{% navigation_tag "areadouble" "Area" "Double integrals" %}
<h5>Area when changing variables in double integrals</h5>

<p>To {%intlink double_integral_change_variables_introduction%}change variables in a double integral{%endintlink%}, we find a function $(x,y) =
\cvarf(\cvarfv,\cvarsv)$ that maps some new region $\dlr^*$ in $(\cvarfv,\cvarsv)$-space to the
original region $\dlr$ in $(x,y)$-space.  We then need a factor that
accounts for the expansion or contraction of $\cvarf$ as it maps $\dlr^*$
onto $\dlr$.  The area expansion factor is the absolute value of the determinant of the
{%intlink derivative_matrix %}matrix of partial derivatives{%endintlink%} of $\cvarf$:
\begin{align*}
   \left| \det \jacm{\cvarf}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv) \right|.
\end{align*}
We sometimes write this is
\begin{align*}
   \left| \det \jacm{\cvarf}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv) \right| = \left|
   \pdiff{(x,y)}{(\cvarfv,\cvarsv)} \right|.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
With the proper area expansion factor, the formula for changing variables in double integrals is
\begin{align*}
  \iint_\dlr \dlsi\, dA = \iint_{\dlr^{\textstyle *}} \dlsi(\cvarf(\cvarfv,\cvarsv))
  \left| \det \jacm{\cvarf}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv) \right| d\cvarfv\,d\cvarsv.
\end{align*}
</p>

{% navigation_tag "areasurface" "Area" "Surface integrals" %}
<h5>Area in surface integrals</h5>

<p>In {%intlink surface_integral_scalar_function_introduction%}surface integrals{%endintlink%},
a surface $\dls$ is
parametrized by a function $\dlsp(\spfv,\spsv)$ for $(\spfv,\spsv) \in \dlr$,
where $\dlr$ is a planar region.  In this case, the
area measure on the surface is 
\begin{align*}
  d\sas = \left\| \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv} \times
    \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}\right\| \,d\spfv\,d\spsv.
\end{align*}
The area expansion factor
$\left\| \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv} \times
    \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}\right\|$
accounts for expansion or contraction by $\dlsp$
when it maps $\dlr$ onto $\dls$.  Hence, the integral of
a scalar-valued function $\dlsi(\vc{x})$ is
\begin{align*}
  \dssint  = \dpssint.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>For  {%intlink surface_integral_vector_field_introduction%}surface integrals of vector fields{%endintlink%}, we integrate
$\dlsi = \dlvf \cdot \vc{n}$, where $\vc{n}$ is the unit normal
vector of the surface:
  \begin{align*}
    \vc{n} = \frac{\pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}
  \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}}
    {\left\|\pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}
  \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}\right\|}.
  \end{align*}
  In this case, the denominator cancels the
  $\left\|\pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv} \times
    \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}\right\|$ factor, so the integral becomes
\begin{align*}
  \dsint = \dpsint.
\end{align*}
The expansion or contraction of $\dlsp(\spfv,\spsv)$ is still included in the
$\left(\pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}
  \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}\right)$ factor.</p>


{% navigation_tag "volume" "Volume" %}
<h4>Volume expansion factors</h4>

<p>Three-dimensional integrals are based on the {%intlink triple_integral_introduction%}triple integral{%endintlink%}
of a function $\dlsi(x,y,z)$ over a three-dimensional region $\dlv$,
\begin{align*}
  \iiint_\dlv \dlsi\, dV = \iiint_\dlv \dlsi(x,y,z) \, dx\,dy\,dz.
\end{align*}
In the triple integral, we can think of $dV=dx\,dy\,dz$ as being a volume
measurement.</p>

<p>Triple integrals under a change of variables 
involve volume-changing maps of one three-dimensional region onto another.  To correctly compute triple integrals,
one must account for how the maps change volume.
The integrals will include an
&ldquo;volume expansion factor&rdquo; that multiplies $dx\,dy\,dz$ in order to 
accurately account for volume.
</p>

{% navigation_tag "volumetriple" "Volume" "Triple integrals"%}
<h5>Volume when change variables in triple integrals</h5>

<p>To {% intlink triple_integral_change_variables_story %}change variables in a triple integral{%endintlink%}, we find a function $(x,y,z) =
\cvarf(\cvarfv,\cvarsv,\cvartv)$ that maps some new solid $\dlv^*$ in $(\cvarfv,\cvarsv,\cvartv)$-space to the
original solid $\dlv$ in $(x,y,z)$-space.  We then need a factor that
accounts for the expansion or contraction of $\cvarf$ as it maps $\dlv^*$
onto $\dlv$.  The volumne expansion factor is the absolute value of the determinant of the
{%intlink derivative_matrix %}matrix of partial derivatives{%endintlink%} of $\cvarf$:
\begin{align*}
   \left| \det \jacm{\cvarf}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv,\cvartv) \right|.
\end{align*}
We sometimes write this is
\begin{align*}
   \left| \det \jacm{\cvarf}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv,\cvartv) \right| = \left|
   \pdiff{(x,y,z)}{(\cvarfv,\cvarsv,\cvartv)} \right|.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>With the proper volume expansion factor, the formula for changing variables in triple integrals is 
\begin{align*}
  \iiint_\dlv \dlsi\, dV = \iiint_{\dlv^{\textstyle *}} \dlsi(\cvarf(\cvarfv,\cvarsv,\cvartv))
  \left| \det \jacm{\cvarf}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv,\cvartv) \right| d\cvarfv\,d\cvarsv\,d\cvartv.
\end{align*}
