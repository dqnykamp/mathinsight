{% title "Introduction to triple integrals" %}
{% description "An introduction to the definition of triple integrals as well as their formulation as iterated integrals." %}

<p>Remember how {%intlink double_integral_introduction%}double 
integrals{%endintlink%} can be written as
{%intlink double_integral_iterated %}iterated integrals{%endintlink%}.
Triple integrals are essentially the same thing as double integrals.
(We just add a third dimension.)  We will turn triple integrals into
(triple) iterated integrals.</p>

<p>Just as with double integrals, the only trick is determining the
limits on the iterated integrals.  (Unfortunately, it's harder to
draw in three dimensions.)</p>

<p>Before discussing <a href="#tripleiterated">how to set up the iterated integrals</a>, we first address how to define triple integrals in the same way we define most of our integrals: with a Riemann sum.</p>


{% navigation_tag "tripleriemann" "Riemann sums" %}
<h4>Defined by Riemann sums</h4>

<p>Let $f(x,y,z)$ be the density of a three-dimensional solid $\dlv$ at the point $(x,y,z)$ inside the solid.  We
want to define the triple integral of $f$ over $\dlv$ to be the total
mass of $\dlv$.</p>

<p>As with double integrals, we define the integral with Riemann sums.
We chop up the solid $\dlv$ into small boxes, say with dimensions $\Delta
x$, $\Delta y$, $\Delta z$.  If $\dlv$ happened to be a cube, this
chopping might look something like this.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image chopped_box %}</p>

<p>The volume of each small box is 
\begin{align*}
  \Delta V = \Delta x \Delta y \Delta z.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>Think of the boxes as being arranged in layers, with each layer
arranged into rows and columns.  We can then index the boxes so that
box $ijk$ refers to the box in the $i$th row, the $j$th column, and
the $k$th layer. </p>

<p>For each box, we pick a point in the box to represent that box.  For
box $ijk$, we call that point $(x_{ijk}, y_{ijk}, z_{ijk})$.  Pretend
that the density of box $ijk$ is constant, i.e., that the
density is $f(x_{ijk}, y_{ijk}, z_{ijk})$ everywhere in that box. The
mass of box $ijk$ is its density times it volume:
\begin{align*}
  f(x_{ijk}, y_{ijk}, z_{ijk}) \Delta V.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>We sum up these approximate masses to estimate the total mass of the solid
$\dlv$.  We obtain the
Riemann sum
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{ijk} f(x_{ijk}, y_{ijk}, z_{ijk})\Delta V,
\end{align*}
where the sum is over all small boxes. </p>

<p>Let $\Delta x \to 0$, $\Delta y \to 0$, and $\Delta z \to 0$ 
(and let the number of small boxes go to infinity).  The Riemann sum
approaches the triple integral over the solid $\dlv$,
\begin{align*}
  \iiint_\dlv f\, dV = \lim_{\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z \to 0}
  \sum_{ijk} f(x_{ijk}, y_{ijk}, z_{ijk}) \Delta V,
\end{align*}
assuming $f$ is continuous.  The triple integral is the actual mass of $\dlv$.</p>

{% navigation_tag "tripleiterated" "Iterated integrals" %}
<h4>Triple iterated integrals</h4>

<p>If the solid $\dlv$ is a cube defined by $a \le x \le b$, $c \le y \le
d$, and $p \le z \le q$, then we can easily write the triple integral
as an iterated integral.  We could first integrate $x$ from $a$ to
$b$, then integrate $y$ from $c$ to $d$, and finally integrate $z$
from $p$ to $q$,
\begin{align*}
  \iiint_\dlv f\, dV = \int_p^q \left(\int_c^d \left(\int_a^b
      f(x,y,z) dx \right ) dy \right) dz.
\end{align*}
This order of integration corresponds a certain way of ordering the terms in the Riemann sum: first, we sum over rows $i$, then we sum over columns $j$, and
finally we sum over layers $k$.</p>


<p>Just as with double integrals, other orders of integration are
possible.  We could, for example, first integrate with respect to $z$, then integrate with respect to $x$, and lastly integrate with respect to $y$,
\begin{align*}
  \iiint_\dlv f\, dV = \int_c^d \left(\int_a^b \left(\int_p^q
      f(x,y,z) dz \right ) dx \right) dy
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>The integration always proceeds from the inside to the outside.  
The integration order coincides with the order that the differentials (e.g. $dx$) appear, so we can specify the integration order by a list of the differentials.  The previous integral is in the order $dz\,dx\,dy$.  With this understanding, the parentheses become optional, and we usually omit them, writing the previous integral as
\begin{align*}
  \iiint_\dlv f\, dV = \int_c^d \int_a^b \int_p^q
      f(x,y,z) dz\, dx \, dy.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>The iterated integral is simple when the solid $\dlv$ is a rectangular
solid (like a cube, but where all edges aren't necessarily the same
length).  For more complicated shapes, finding the limits of
integration can be tricky.  </p>

<p class="pre_list">As a first step, just remember these rules, which are analogous to the rules
we had for limits on double iterated integrals. </p>
<ol>
<li>The outer limits have to be constant.  They cannot depend on any
  of the variables.</li>
<li>The middle limits can depend on the variable from the outer
  integral only.  They cannot depend on the variable from the inner
  integral.</li>
<li>The inner limits can depend on the variable from the outer
  integral and the variable from the middle integral.</li>
</ol>


<p>For example, the following integral makes sense
\begin{align*}
  \iiint_\dlv f\, dV = \int_2^3 \int_{1-z}^0 \int_{-y^2-z^2}^{y^2+z^2}
        f(x,y,z) dx\, dy \, dz.
\end{align*}
It describes the integral of $f$ over the region $\dlv$ defined by
\begin{gather*}
  2 \le z \le 3,\\
  1-z \le y \le 0,\\
  -y^2-z^2 \le x \le y^2+z^2
\end{gather*}
(not that you should be able to visualize what $\dlv$ looks like).</p>
<div style="visibility:hidden; position:absolute; top:0, height:0">$\cancel{}$</div>

<p>The following integral does not make sense
\begin{align*}
  \iiint_\dlv f\, dV = \color{red}{\xcancel{\color{black}{\int_y^x \int_{1}^{2x} \int_0^1
        f(x,y,z) dx \, dy \, dz.}}}
\end{align*}
Can you see why?  The outer integral limits depend on both $x$ and $y$ (but
$y$ isn't defined until you go inside the middle integral, and $x$
isn't defined until you go inside the inner integral).  Also, the middle
integral limits depend on $x$.</p>

<p>A tricky part of triple integrals is determining the limits of integration (or bounds).  Two methods for determining bounds are the {% intlink triple_integral_shadow_method%}shadow method{%endintlink%} and the {% intlink triple_integral_cross_section_method%}cross section method{%endintlink%}.  Nothing beats practice in learning to compute triple integrals, and you can try your hand on some of these
