{% description "A summary of the integrals of multivariable calculus, including calculation methods and their relationship to the fundamental theorems of vector calculus." %}

<p>Multivariable calculus includes six different generalizations 
of the familiar one-variable integral of a scalar-valued function
over an interval.  
One can integrate functions over one-dimensional curves, two dimensional
planar regions and surfaces, as well as three-dimensional volumes. 
When integrating over curves and surfaces, one can integral vector fields,
where the one integrates either the tangential (for curves) or the
normal (for surfaces) component of the vector field.</p>

<p>In this page, we outline the various integrals, methods you can use to solve
them, and their relationship to the {% intlink fundamental_theorems_vector_calculus_summary %}fundamental theorems{%endintlink%}.</p>

{% navigation_tag "lineintscalar" "The integrals" "Scalar line integral"%}
<h4>Line integral of scalar-valued function</h4>

<p>The {%intlink line_integral_scalar_function_introduction%}line integral 
of a scalar-valued function{%endintlink%} $\dlsi(\vc{x})$ over a curve $\dlc$ 
is written as 
\begin{align*}
  \dslint.
\end{align*}
One physical interpretation of this line integral is that it gives the 
mass of a wire from its density $\dlsi$.</p>

<p>The only way we've encountered to evaluate this integral is the direct
method.  We must parametrize $\dlc$ by some function $\dllp(t)$, for $a
\le t \le b$.  Then, we can calculate the line integral by turning it
into a regular one-variable integral of the form
\begin{align*}
   \dslint = \dpslint.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>Note that the &ldquo;length&rdquo; $d\als$ became $\| \dllp'(t)\|dt$.  
This quantity $\| \dllp'(t)\|$  measures how
$\dllp(t)$ stretches or shrinks the interval $[a,b]$ as it maps it
onto $\dlc$.</p>

{% navigation_tag "lineintvector" "The integrals" "Vector line integral"%}
<h4>Line integral of a vector field</h4>

<p>The {%intlink line_integral_vector_field_introduction%}line integral
 of a vector field{%endintlink%} $\dlvf(\vc{x})$
over a curve $\dlc$ is written as
\begin{align*}
  \dlint.
\end{align*}
One physical interpretation of this line integral is the calculation 
of work when a particle moves along a path.
If $\dlvf$ were a force acting on a particle moving
along $\dlc$, then the integral would be the total work performed by the
force on the particle.</p>

<p>This integral is one of the most important of multivariable calculus.  
We have
four alternatives to evaluate the integral, although most of the
alternatives work only in special cases.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> We can compute the integral directly.  We parametrize $\dlc$ by
  some function $\dllp(t)$, for $a \le t \le b$.  Then
  \begin{align*}
    \dlint = \dplint
  \end{align*}
  </p>

  <p>This method always applies.  Sometimes, though, the integral will be
  difficult or we won't even be able to evaluate it.  Our lives can be
  made easier by using one of the 
    {% intlink fundamental_theorems_vector_calculus_summary %}fundamental theorems{%endintlink%}
  to convert the line integral into something else.</p>
  
  <p>Since this integral is really a
   <a href="#lineintscalar">line integral of the scalar-valued function</a> $\dlsi =
  \dlvf \cdot \vc{T}$ where $\vc{T}$ is the unit tangent vector
  \begin{align*}
    \vc{T} = \frac{ \dllp'(t)}{\| \dllp'(t)\|},
  \end{align*}
  the formula for the direct method is the same as the formula for the
  scalar-valued path integral with $\dlsi =   \dlvf \cdot \vc{T}$.</p>
  </li>

<li><p>If the vector field $\dlvf$ {% intlink conservative_vector_field_determine%}happens to be conservative{%endintlink%},
    then we could use the {% intlink gradient_theorem_line_integrals%}gradient theorem for line integrals{%endintlink%}.
    We reduce the problem from an integral over the
    curve $\dlc$ to something just depending on the &ldquo;boundary&rdquo; of $\dlc$,  i.e., its endpoints.  </p>
    
  <p>We need to {% intlink conservative_vector_field_find_potential %}find a potential function{%endintlink%} $f$ so
  that $\nabla f = \dlvf$.  Then,
  \begin{align*}
    \dlint  = f(\vc{q}) - f(\vc{p}),
  \end{align*}
  where $\vc{p}$ and $\vc{q}$ are the endpoints of $\dlc$.</p>
  
  <p>If $\dlc$ also happens to be a closed curve, then the integral of
    a conservative vector field $\dlvf$ will be zero.  
    Also, that if you know $\dlvf$ is conservative, another thing you can do is just change the curve
  $\dlc$ to another curve that has the same endpoints as $\dlc$.  In this
  case, the line integral of $\dlvf$ over $\dlc$ is the same as the line
  integral of $\dlvf$ over any other curve with the same endpoints.</p>
</li>
  
<li><p>If the vector field $\dlvf$ and the curve $\dlc$ happen to be in
    two dimensions and if $\dlc$ happens to be a 
    {%intlink simple_curve_definition %}simple{%endintlink%}
    {%intlink closed_curve_definition %}closed{%endintlink%}
    curve, then we
    can use {%intlink greens_theorem_idea %}Green's theorem{%endintlink%}.
    Green's theorem converts the line integral over $\dlc$ to a double
    integral over the interior of $\dlc$, which we call $\dlr$,
    \begin{align*}
    \dlint  = \iint_\dlr \left(\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} -
    \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y} \right) \, dA.
    \end{align*}
    Note that $\dlvf$ must be continuously differentiable everywhere in $\dlr$ for this to work.
    Sometimes we write $\dlc= \partial \dlr$ to denote that $\dlc$ is the
    boundary of $\dlr$.  $\dlc$ must be oriented in a counterclockwise
    fashion, otherwise, we'll be off by a minus sign.</p>
  </li>

<li><p> If the vector field $\dlvf$ and the curve $\dlc$ happen to be in
  three dimensions and if $\dlc$ happens to be a    
    {%intlink simple_curve_definition %}simple{%endintlink%}
    {%intlink closed_curve_definition %}closed{%endintlink%}
    curve, then we
  can use {%intlink stokes_theorem_idea %}Stokes' theorem{%endintlink%}.
  Stokes' theorem converts the line integral over $\dlc$ to a surface
  integral over any surface $\dls$ for which $\dlc$ is a boundary,
  \begin{align*}
    \dlint  = \sint{\dls}{\curl \dlvf},
  \end{align*}
  and is valid for any surface over which $\dlvf$ is continuously differentiable.
  Sometimes we write $\dlc= \partial \dls$ to denote that $\dlc$ is the
  boundary of $\dls$.  $\dlc$ must be a {% intlink positively_oriented_boundary_definition%}positively oriented boundary{%endintlink%} of $\dls$, otherwise, we'll be off by a minus sign.</p>
</li>
</ol>

{% navigation_tag "surfintscalar" "The integrals" "Scalar surface integral"%}
<h4>Surface integral of a scalar-valued function</h4>

<p>The {%intlink surface_integral_scalar_function_introduction%}surface integral of a scalar-valued function{%endintlink%}
$\dlsi(\vc{x})$ over a surface $\dls$  is written as 
\begin{align*}
  \dssint
\end{align*}
One physical interpretation of the integral is the mass of a sheet with density given by $\dlsi$.</p>

<p>The only way we've encountered to evalute this integral is the direct
method.  We must parametrize $\dls$ by some function $\dlsp(\spfv,\spsv)$, for $(\spfv,\spsv) \in \dlr$.  Then,
\begin{align*}
   \dssint = \dpssint
\end{align*}</p>

<p>Note that the &ldquo;area&rdquo; $d\sas$ became $\left\| \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}
  \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}\right\| \,d\spfv\,d\spsv$.  
The quantity $d\sas$ became $\left\| \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}
  \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}\right\|$  measures how
$\dlsp(\spfv,\spsv)$ stretches or shrinks the region $\dlr$ as it maps it
onto $\dls$.</p>

{% navigation_tag "surfintvector" "The integrals" "Vector surface integral"%}
<h4>Surface integral of a vector field</h4>

<p>The surface integral over surface $\dls$ of a vector field $\dlvf(\vc{x})$
is written as 
\begin{align*}
  \dsint.
\end{align*}
A physical interpretation is the flux of a fluid through $\dls$ whose
velocity is given by $\dlvf$.
For this reason, we sometimes
refer to the integral as a &ldquo;flux integral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like the <a href="#lineintvector">line integral of a vector field</a>,
this integral plays a big role in this course.  We have three
alternatives to evaluate the integral, although most of the
alternatives work only in special cases.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We can compute the integral directly.  We parametrize $\dls$ by
    some function $\dlsp(\spfv,\spsv)$, for $(\spfv,\spsv) \in \dlr$.  Then,
    \begin{align*}
    \dsint = \dpsint.
    \end{align*}
  </p>

  <p>This method always applies.  Sometimes, though, the integral will be
    difficult or we won't even be able to evaluate it.  Our lives can be
  made easier by using one of the
    {% intlink fundamental_theorems_vector_calculus_summary %}fundamental theorems{%endintlink%}
  to convert the surface integral into something else.</p>
  
  <p>Since this integral is really a <a href="#surfintscalar">surface
    integral of the scalar-valued function</a> $\dlsi = \dlvf \cdot
  \vc{n}$ where $\vc{n}$ is the unit normal vector
  \begin{align*}
    \vc{n} = \frac{\displaystyle\pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}
  \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}}
    {\displaystyle\left\|\pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}
  \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}\right\|},
  \end{align*}
  the formula for the direct method is the same as the formula for the
  scalar-valued surface integral with $\dlsi = \dlvf \cdot
  \vc{n}$.</p></li>
  
<li><p>If the vector field $\dlvf$ happens to be the curl of another
  vector field $\vc{G}$, i.e., $\dlvf = \curl \vc{G}$, then we can
  apply {% intlink stokes_theorem_idea %}Stokes' theorem{%endintlink%} to convert the surface
  integral of $\curl \vc{G}$ into the line integral of $\vc{G}$ around
  the {%intlink positively_oriented_boundary_definition%}positively oriented boundary{%endintlink%} of $\dls$, which we
  denote $\partial \dls$,
  \begin{align*}
    \dsint = \sint{\dls}{\curl \vc{G}}
    =\lint{\dlc}{\vc{G}}
  \end{align*}
  </p>
  
  <p>Multivariable calculus student's don't typically learn methods to find $\vc{G}$ from
  $\dlvf$.  We can use Stokes' theorem to convert a surface integral
  into a line integral only if we are told outright that $\dlvf =
  \curl \vc{G}$ and are given what $\vc{G}$ is.  But, if given the
  surface integral that looks like $\sint{\dls}{\curl \vc{G}}$, we can
  immediately recognize that Stokes' theorem is an option.</p>
  
  <p>Stokes' theorem allows us to do one more thing to the
  integral $\sint{\dls}{\curl \vc{G}}$.  We can
  switch the surface $\dls$ to any other surface $\dls'$ as long as the
  boundaries of $\dls$ and $\dls'$ are the same, i.e., $\partial \dls =
  \partial \dls'$ (assuming both boundaries are {%intlink positively_oriented_boundary_definition%}positively oriented{%endintlink%}).  If $\dls$ is a complicated surface, we could feasibly save
  ourselves some work by integrating over another surface $\dls'$ if that
  surface is simpler than $\dls$.</p></li>

<li><p>If the surface $\dls$ happens to be a closed surface so that it
  is the boundary of some solid $\dlv$, i.e., $\dls = \partial \dlv$,
  then we can use the {%intlink divergence_theorem_idea %}divergence theorem{%endintlink%} 
  to convert the surface integral into the triple
  integral of $\div \dlvf$ over $\dlv$,
  \begin{align*}
    \dsint = \iiint_\dlv \div
    \dlvf \, dV,
  \end{align*}
  where we orient $\dls$ so that it has an outward pointing normal
  vector.  This works only if $\dlvf$ is continuously differentiable
  everywhere in the solid $\dlv$.</p></li>
</ol>

{% navigation_tag "doubleint" "The integrals" "Double integral"%}
<h4>Double integrals</h4>

<p>The {%intlink double_integral_introduction %}double integral{%endintlink%} of a (scalar-valued) function $\dlsi(\vc{x})$ over a
two-dimensional region $\dlr$ is written as
\begin{align*}
  \iint_\dlr \dlsi \, dA.
\end{align*}
One physical interpretation is the mass of a region with density \dlsi$.</p>

<p>We have encountered three alternatives to evaluate the integral.
<ol>
  <li><p>We can compute the integral directly in terms of the original
  variables $x$ and $y$.  In this case, $dA = dx\,dy$.</p></li>

  <li><p>We can compute the integral by {% intlink double_integral_change_variables_introduction%}changing to the variables{%endintlink%} $\cvarfv$ and
  $\cvarsv$ by finding a function $(x,y) = \vc{T}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv)$.  Then the integral
  is
  \begin{align*}
    \iint_\dlr \dlsi\, dA = \left.\iint_{\dlr^{\textstyle *}}\right. \dlsi(\vc{T}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv))
    \left| \det \jacm{\vc{T}}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv) \right| d\cvarfv\,d\cvarsv,
  \end{align*}
  where $\dlr$ is parametrized by $(x,y)=\vc{T}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv)$ for $(\cvarfv,\cvarsv)$ in
  $\dlr^{\textstyle *}$.  We sometimes write the determinant of the matrix of
  partial derivatives 
  of $\vc{T}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv)$ as $\displaystyle \det \jacm{\vc{T}}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv) =
  \pdiff{(x,y)}{(\cvarfv,\cvarsv)}$.</p></li>

<li><p> If $f$ happens to be equal to $\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} -
  \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}$ for some vector field $\dlvf$, then we could use
  {%intlink greens_theorem_idea %}Green's theorem{%endintlink%}
  to convert the double integral
  into the integral of $\dlvf$ around the boundary of $\dlr$, which we
  denote $\partial \dlr$,
  \begin{align*}
    \iint_\dlr f \, dA = \iint_\dlr \left(\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} -
  \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}\right) dA = \lint{\partial \dlr}{\dlvf}.
  \end{align*}
  To orient the boundary properly, outside boundaries must be
  counterclockwise and inner boundaries must be clockwise.</p>
  
  <p>We usually think of Green's theorem going the other way, i.e.,
  converting a line integral into a double integral.  One reason for
  this is that multivariable calculus students don't usually learn methods to find $\dlvf$ from $f$.
  We can use Green's theorem to convert a double integral into a line
  integral only if we are told outright that $f =\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} -
  \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}$ and are given what $\dlvf$ is.  But, if given the
  double integral that looks like $\iint_\dlr \left(\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} -
  \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}\right) dA$, we can immediately recognize that Green's
  theorem is an option.</p>

  <p>As a special case, if we are given an
  integral $\iint_\dlr dA$ (i.e., {%intlink greens_theorem_find_area %}finding the area{%endintlink%}), we can let
  $\dlvf(x,y) = (-y,x)/2$ so that $\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} -
  \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y} =1$ and $\iint_\dlr dA = \lint{\partial \dlr}{\dlvf}$.</p>
</li>
</ol>

{% navigation_tag "tripleint" "The integrals" "Triple integral"%}
<h4>Triple integrals</h4>

<p>The {%intlink triple_integral_introduction %}triple integral{%endintlink%} of a (scalar-valued) function $\dlsi(\vc{x})$ over a
three-dimensional solid $\dlv$ is written as
\begin{align*}
  \iiint_\dlv \dlsi \, dV.
\end{align*}
One physical interpretation is the mass of a solid with density given by $\dlsi$.</p>

<p>We have encountered three alternatives to evaluate the integral.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We can compute the integral directly in terms of the original
    variables $x$, $y$, and $z$.  In this case, $dV = dx\,dy\,dz$.</p></li>
  
<li><p>We can compute the integral by {%intlink triple_integral_change_variables_story%}changing to the variables{%endintlink%} $\cvarfv$,
  $\cvarsv$, and $\cvartv$ by finding a function $(x,y,z) = \vc{T}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv,\cvartv)$.  Then
  the integral is
  \begin{align*}
    \iiint_\dlv \dlsi\, dV = \left.\iiint_{\dlv^{\textstyle *}}\right. \dlsi(\vc{T}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv,\cvartv))
    \left| \det \jacm{\vc{T}}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv,\cvartv) \right| d\cvarfv\,d\cvarsv\,d\cvartv,
  \end{align*}
  where $\dlv$ is parametrized by $(x,y,z)=\vc{T}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv,\cvartv)$ for $(\cvarfv,\cvarsv,\cvartv)$
  in $\dlv^{\textstyle *}$.  We sometimes write the determinant of the matrix
  of partial derivatives of $\vc{T}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv,\cvartv)$ as $\displaystyle \det
  \jacm{\vc{T}}(\cvarfv,\cvarsv,\cvartv) = \pdiff{(x,y,z)}{(\cvarfv,\cvarsv,\cvartv)}$.</p></li>

<li><p>If $\dlsi$ happens to be equal to $\div \dlvf$ for some vector
  field $\dlvf$, then we could use the
  {%intlink divergence_theorem_idea%}divergence theorem{%endintlink%}
  to convert the triple integral into the surface
  integral of $\dlvf$ around the boundary of $\dlv$, which we denote
  $\partial \dlv$,
  \begin{align*}
     \iiint_\dlv \dlsi\, dV =  \iiint_\dlv \div \dlvf\, dV 
     = \sint{\partial \dlv}{\dlvf}.
  \end{align*}
  </p>
  
  <p>We usually think of the divergence theorem going the other way,
  i.e., converting a surface integral into a triple integral.  One
  reason for this is that multivariable calculus student don't typically learn  methods to find $\dlvf$
  from $f$.  We can use the divergence theorem to convert a triple
  integral into a surface integral only if we are told outright that
  $\dlsi = \div \dlvf$ and are given what $\dlvf$ is.  But, if given a
  triple integral that looks like $\iiint_\dlv \div\dlvf \, dV$,
  we can immediately recognize that the divergence theorem is an
  option.</p></li>
