<h4>Rectangular domain</h4>

<p>We want to compute the double integral of $f(x,y)$ over the domain
$\dlr$, where $\dlr$ is a rectangle with $a \le x \le b$ and $c \le y
\le d$.   Using the
{% intlink "double_integral_introduction" %}definition of the double 
integral{%endintlink%}, we could estimate the integral
\begin{align*}
  \iint_\dlr f(x,y) dA
\end{align*}
with Riemann sums.  We chop up the domain $\dlr$ in little rectangles.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "rectangle_chopped" %}</p>

<p>If we pick the same $y_i$ for every rectangle in row $i$ and the same
$x_j$ for every rectangle in column $j$, the Riemann sum for the integral is
\begin{align}
  \sum_{i,j} f(x_{j}, y_{i}) \Delta x \Delta y.    
  \label{Riemannsum}
\end{align}
</p>

<p>Now, here's the trick. We could add across the rows first, then add
the rows.  We would still get the same answer.  In order words, for
any given row $i$, we could sum across all columns $j$.  If we ignore
$\Delta y$ for the moment, the sum across all columns $j$ is
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{j} f(x_{j}, y_{i}) \Delta x.
\end{align*}
If we let the $\Delta x$ shrink to zero (and the number of columns grow
correspondingly to infinity), then this is exactly the Riemann sum for the
one-dimensional integral, where we integrate $x$ from $a$ to $b$:
\begin{align*}
  \int_{a}^{b} f(x,y_i) dx.
\end{align*}
We get a different value of this integral for each $y_i$,
corresponding to the sum across row $i$.  If we now multiply by
$\Delta y$ and sum over all rows $i$ (as we need to get to the full
Riemann sum of equation \eqref{Riemannsum}),
 we get another
one-dimensional Riemann sum:  
\begin{align*}
  \sum_i \left(\int_{a}^{b} f(x,y_i) dx \right) \Delta y.
\end{align*}
If we let the $\Delta y$ shrink to zero (and the number of rows grow
correspondingly to infinity), then the Riemann sum becomes another
one-dimensional integral, where we integrate $y$ from $c$ to $d$:
\begin{align*}
   \int_c^d \left(\int_a^b f(x,y) dx \right) dy.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
This procedure was equivalent to summing across all of the rectangle,
then letting $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ go to zero.  So, we have just
obtained another expression for the double integral:
\begin{align*}
  \iint_\dlr f(x,y) dA = \int_c^d \left(\int_a^b f(x,y) dx \right) dy.
\end{align*}
We call this an <b>iterated integral</b>, because we simply iterate
one-variable integration two times.</p>

<p>Of course, we could have added down the columns first, then added the
columns together.  This would result in an iterated integral in the
reverse order:
\begin{align*}
   \iint_\dlr f(x,y) dA = \int_a^b \left(\int_c^d f(x,y) dy \right) dx.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>So, we now have two ways we turn the double integral
\begin{align*}
  \iint_\dlr f(x,y) dA
\end{align*}
into one-variable integrals.  In this way, we don't have to learn any
more integration formulas to compute double integrals.  This is
similar to how we can compute 
{% intlink "partial_derivative_introduction" %}partial derivatives{%endintlink%}
by using our one-variable
differentiation rules.  The trick in computing partial derivatives was
treating all the other variables as constant.  As you'll see in the
{% intlink "double_integral_examples" %}examples{%endintlink%}, we use a
similar trick to compute iterated integrals.</p>

<p>We often drop the parentheses from iterated integrals, and write
them, for example, as
\begin{align*}
  \int_c^d \left(\int_a^b f(x,y) dx \right) dy
  =    \int_c^d \int_a^b f(x,y) dx\, dy.
\end{align*}</p>

<p>You can read an {% intlink "double_integral_examples" %}example{%endintlink%} of
computing iterated integrals over rectangular domains.</p>

<p>We arbitrarily chose to sum across the rows first.  
We could just have easily chosen to sum across the columns first,
which would have given us iterated integrals where we integrate
with respect to $y$ first.  
One can switch between these two orders, which is referred to as
{% intlink "double_integral_change_order_integration_examples" %}changing
the order of the integration{%endintlink%}.</p>


<h4>Other domains</h4>

<p>If the region $\dlr$ is not a rectangle, we can still convert the
double integral into one or more iterated integrals.  In this case,
the limits of integration will be a little more complicated.  Rather
than attempt to introduce the general theory, we'll just present how
to do these using
