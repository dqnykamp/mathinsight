{% description "Illustration of a region where integrating a double integral in one order is must easier than integrating in the other order." %}

<p>Suppose you need to calculate the double integral $\iint_\dlr
f(x,y)\,dA$ for some function $f(x,y)$ and the region $\dlr$ shown below.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "double_integral_region_x_first" %}</p>

<p>To calculate the double integral, you can write it as an 
{% intlink "double_integral_iterated" %}iterated integral{%endintlink%}.
For example, let's say that in the region $\dlr$, the lowest value
of $y$ is $a$ and the highest value of $y$ is $b$.  In other words,
the range of $y$  in the region $\dlr$ is $a \le y \le b$.</p>

<p>For a given value of $y$, the range of $x$ in $\dlr$ depends on the value
of $y$.  However, the region is nice enough so that the range of $x$
for any $y$ is just a simple interval.  We could define two functions
$h_1(y)$ and to $h_2(y)$ so that this interval in $x$ is $[h_1(y),h_2(y)]$
for each value of $y$.  This description of the region $\dlr$ is shown in
the following picture.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "double_integral_region_x_first_labeled" %}</p>


<p>Since the region $\dlr$ is defined by 
\begin{gather*}
  a \le y \le b,\\
  h_1(y) \le x \le h_2(y),
\end{gather*}
we can represent double integral of $f(x,y)$ over $\dlr$ as the
following iterated integral,
\begin{align*}
  \iint_\dlr f(x,y) dA = \int_a^b \left( \int_{h_1(y)}^{h_2(y)}
    f(x,y) dx \right) dy.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>However, we would run into trouble if we tried to {% intlink "double_integral_change_order_integration_examples" %}change the order of
integration{%endintlink%} so that we integrated with respect to $y$ first.
The difficulty is that the range of $y$ for some values
of $x$ is not a simple interval.  For example, for the value of $x$
given by the vertical dashed line below, the range of $y$ is
<b>two different intervals</b>.  
</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "double_integral_region_x_first_not_y" %}</p>

<p>Since we cannot always write the range of $y$ as a single interval
$[g_1(x),g_2(x)]$, we cannot write the integral $\iint_\dlr f(x,y)\,dA$
as a single iterated integral of the form
\begin{align*}
    \iint_\dlr f(x,y) dA = \int_c^d \left( \int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)}
    f(x,y) dy \right) dx.
\end{align*}
If we really wanted to integrate with respect to $y$ first, we'd have
to break the region $\dlr$ into pieces and compute separate integrals for
each piece.  We'll leave that procedure to your imagination.
