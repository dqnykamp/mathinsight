{% description "The definition of a double integral is motivated through a hair density example." %}

<p>Suppose that you knew the hair density at each point on your head and
you wanted to calculate the total number of hairs on your head. </p>

<p>In other words, let $(x,y)$ be a point that is $x$ millimeters to the
right and $y$ millimeters above some reference point, say your nose.
We are assuming that you already know the function $f(x,y)$ that gives
hair density in hairs per square millimeter at point $(x,y)$.  The
following might be a method to use your knowledge of $f(x,y)$ to
estimate the number of hairs on your body.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Cut and flatten your skin so it lies in a plane.</p>

    <p class="centeredImage">{% image flattened_head %}</p>

    <p>
  (Although this has nothing to do with double integrals, brain
  mappers and cartographers face similar problems.  To map the brain
  or the surface of the earth, one looks for ways to flatten these
  surfaces into a plane.)</p>
    </li>
  
  <li><p>Divide your skin into small rectangles of width $\Delta x$ and
  height $\Delta y$.</p>

    <p class="centeredImage">{% image flattened_head_rectangles %}</p>
    </li>

  <li><p> Label each rectangle according to row $i$ and column $j$.  For
  rectangle $ij$, pick some point in the rectangle, and call it
  $(x_{ij},y_{ij})$.  Since you know your hair density function, you
  can look up the hair density of that point.  It is simply
  $f(x_{ij},y_{ij})$.  </p>

    <p>Label each rectangle by the number $f(x_{ij},y_{ij})$.</p>
  
    <p class="centeredImage">{% image flattened_head_rectangles_numbers %}</p>
    </li>
  
  <li> <p>If the hair density were constant in each rectangle, the
  number of hairs in rectangle $ij$ would be $f(x_{ij}, y_{ij})$
  times the area of the rectangle.  The area of the rectangle is
  simply its width ($\Delta x$) times its height ($\Delta y$), i.e.,
  the area is $\Delta x \Delta y$.  Hence, the number of hairs in the
  rectangle is approximately $f(x_{ij},y_{ij})\Delta x \Delta y$.</p></li>
 
  <li><p>To estimate the total number of hairs on your head, you can add
  up the (approximate) number of hairs in each rectangle.  Using the
  above result, your estimate for the total number of hairs is
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{i,j} f(x_{ij},y_{ij})\Delta x \Delta y,
  \end{align*}
  where the sum is over all rectangles.</p>
  
    <p>If in the above picture, each rectangle were 75 millimeters wide and
  65 millimeters high, then the resulting estimate of the total number
  of hairs would be $(9+9+8+17+9+3+1+1+11+8+10+8+1+2+3+8+7+2+5+3)
  \cdot 75 \cdot 65 = 609,375$.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><p>The above result is only a rough estimate because it assumed
  that the hair density was constant over each rectangle.  You may
  also have noticed that additional errors are introduced around the
  edges of your skin, where some rectangles are only partly filled
  with skin.  You can increase your accuracy by decreasing the size of
  each rectangle (i.e., decreasing $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$).  Of
  course, to cover your whole head, you'll have to increase the number
  of rectangles as you decrease their size.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>To be really accurate, you should let the size of the rectangles
  go to zero (and the number of rectangles go to infinity).  In other
  words, you should take the limit where $\Delta x \to 0$ and $\Delta y
  \to 0$.</p>
  
    <p>As long as $f(x,y)$ is a continuous function, this procedure will
  converge to a single number, which would be the actual number of hairs
  on your head. 
  \begin{align*}
    \text{Number of hairs on head}  = \lim_{\Delta x, \Delta y \to 0}
    \sum_{i,j} f(x_{ij}, y_{ij}) \Delta x \Delta y
  \end{align*}</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><p> We can put this into math terms.  When we took the limit as
  $\Delta x \to 0$ and $\Delta y \to 0$, we ended up with the definite
  integral of the function $f$ over your head.  If we denote by $\dlr$
  the region of the plane that your skin occupied, then we write this
  integral as
  \begin{align*}
    \iint_\dlr \, f(x,y) dA = \lim_{\Delta x, \Delta y \to 0}
    \sum_{i,j} f(x_{ij}, y_{ij}) \Delta x \Delta y.
  \end{align*}</p>
  
    <p>We refer to this integral as the <b>double integral</b> of $f$ over $\dlr$.</p>

    <p>The sums of step 5 are the Riemann sums that approximate the
  integral.  The integral is the limit of the Riemann sums as the size
  of the rectangles goes to zero.  This is exactly the way you defined
  the integral in one-variable calculus.</p>
  </li>
</ol>



<p>You can read how we can
{%intlink double_integral_volume %}interpret the double integral as 
  volume{%endintlink%} underneath a surface, just like
you could interpret the regular one-variable integral as area under a
curve.  
In this case, we can also visualize the Riemann sum defining the integral as the volume of many boxes, as illustrated in the below applet.  
(More details on this volume interpretation and this applet can be viewed on 
{%intlink double_integral_volume %}this page{%endintlink%}.)

<p>I don't have good examples (other than the above hair-counting
example) on computing double integrals this way, as this is not how
we typically compute them.  Instead, this page is about how we
<b>define</b> a double integral.  We have better ways to compute
double integrals (that is, unless you are a computer, in which case
chopping up the domain in pieces and computing a sum as an
approximation to an integral works pretty well).</p>

<p> You can also read 
  {%intlink double_integral_examples %}examples of computing double 
  integrals{%endintlink%} using the method in
which those of us who are not computers typically use, which is
something called an {%intlink double_integral_iterated%}iterated 
  integral{%endintlink%}.</p>
