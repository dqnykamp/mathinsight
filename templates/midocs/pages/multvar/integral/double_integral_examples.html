<p>To illustrate computing 
{% intlink "double_integral_introduction" %}double integrals{%endintlink%} as
{% intlink "double_integral_iterated" %}iterated integrals{%endintlink%},
 we start with
the simplest example of a double integral over a rectangle and then
move on to an integral over a triangle.</p>

{% navigation_tag "example1" "Examples" "Example 1" %}
<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>Compute the integral 
\begin{align*}
  \iint_\dlr x y^2 dA
\end{align*}
where $\dlr$ is  the rectangle defined by $0 \le x \le 2$ and $0 \le y \le 1$ pictured below.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "double_integral_over_rectangle" %}</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: We will compute the double integral as the
{% intlink "double_integral_iterated" %}iterated integral{%endintlink%}
\begin{align*}
  \int_0^1 \left( \int_0^2 xy^2 dx\right) dy.
\end{align*}
We first integrate with respect to $x$ inside the parentheses.
Similar to the procedure with
{% intlink "partial_derivative_examples" %}partial derivatives{%endintlink%},
we must treat $y$ as a
constant during this integration step.  Since for any constant $c$, the integral of $cx$ is
$cx^2/2$, we calculate
\begin{align*}
  \int_0^1 \left( \int_0^2 xy^2 dx\right) dy 
  &amp;=  \int_0^1 \left(\left. \frac{x^2}{2} y^2 \right|_{x=0}^{x=2}
  \right)dy\\
  &amp;= \int_0^1 \left( \frac{2^2}{2} y^2  - \frac{0^2}{2} y^2  \right)dy  \\
  &amp;= \int_0^1 2 y^2 dy.
\end{align*}
Note that in the first line above, we wrote the limits as $x=2$ and
$x=0$ so it is unambiguous that $x$ is the variable we just
integrated. </p>

<p>To finish, we need to compute the integral with respect to $y$, which
is simple.  Since $x$ is gone, it's just a regular one-variable
integral.  We calculate that our double integral is
\begin{align*}
   \iint_\dlr x y^2 dA &amp;= \int_0^1 2 y^2 dy\\
   &amp;= \left. \frac{2y^3}{3} \right|_0^1 \goodbreak = \frac{2(1^3)}{3}- \frac{2(0^3)}{3}
   \goodbreak =\frac{2}{3}.
\end{align*}
</p>



<p>To double check our answer, we can compute the integral in the other direction,
integrating first with respect to $y$ and then with respect to $x$.
The only trick is to remember that when integrating with
respect to $y$, we must think of $x$ as a constant.  Since for any constant $c$, the
integral of $cy^2$ is $cy^3/3$, we calculate
\begin{align*}
  \iint_\dlr x y^2 dA &amp;= \int_0^2 \left( \int_0^1 xy^2 dy\right) dx\\
  &amp;= \int_0^2 \left(\left. x \frac{y^3}{3} \right|_{y=0}^{y=1}\right)dx\\
  &amp;= \int_0^2 \frac{x}{3} dx\\
  &amp;= \left.\left.\frac{x^2}{6} \right|_0^2\right. = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}.
\end{align*}
As it must, this iterated integral gives the same answer.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Rectangular regions are easy because the limits
($a \le x \le b$ and $c \le y \le d$) are fixed, meaning the ranges of $x$ and $y$ don't depend on each other.  For regions of other shapes, the range of one variable will depend on the other.   Here's an example
where we integrate over the region defined by $0 \le x \le 2$ and $0
\le y \le x/2$.  The fact that the range of $y$ depends on $x$ means this region is not a rectangle.  In fact, the region is the triangle pictured below. </p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "double_integral_over_triangle_x_first" %}</p>

<p>
Using the same function $f(x,y)=xy^2$ as in example 1, compute $\iint_\dlr f\,dA$
where $\dlr$ is the above triangle.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: A triangle is slightly more complicated than a rectangle because the limits of one variable will depend on the other variable.  For the triangle defined by $0 \le x \le 2$
and $0 \le y \le x/2$, the limits of $y$ depend on $x$.  For a given
value of $x$, $y$ ranges from 0 to $x/2$, as illustrated above by the
vertical dashed line from $(x,0)$ to $(x,x/2)$.</p>

<p>In a double integral, the outer limits must be constant, but the inner
limits can depend on the outer variable.  This means, we must put $y$
as the inner integration variables, as was done in the second way of
computing Example 1.  The only difference from Example 1 is that the
upper limit of $y$ is $x/2$.  The double integral is
\begin{align*}
  \iint_\dlr x y^2 dA &amp;= \int_0^2 \left(\int_0^{x/2} xy^2 dy
  \right) dx\\
  &amp;=\int_0^2 \left(\left.\frac{x}{3} y^3 \right|_{y=0}^{y=x/2}\right) dx\\
  &amp;=\int_0^2 \left( \frac{x}{3} \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^3 
  -\frac{x}{3} 0^3  \right) dx\\
  &amp;=  \int_0^2 \frac{x^4}{24} dx\\
  &amp;= \left.\left.\frac{x^5}{5\cdot 24}\right|_0^2\right. = \frac{32}{5 \cdot 24} = \frac{4}{15}.
\end{align*}
</p>

<h4>Example 2'</h4>

<p>Now compute the integral over the same triangle $\dlr$, but make $y$
be the outer integration variable.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: Now we need to give constant limits for $y$.  As
illustrated below, the total range of $y$ within the triangle is between
between $0$ and $1$.  Then, for a given value of $y$, $x$ takes on
values between $2y$ and $2$ (as shown by the horizontal dashed line
between $(2y,y)$ and $(2,y)$).  Hence, we can describe the triangle by
$0 \le y \le 1$ and $2y \le x \le 2$.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "double_integral_over_triangle_y_first" %}</p>


<p>Is it confusing that the limits of $x$ are $2y \le x \le 2$ rather
than $0 \le x \le 2$ (which would more closely parallel the above
Example 2)?  If we let $x$ range from $0$ to $2y$, then the triangle
would be the upper-left triangle in the above picture.  We want to
compute the integral over the region $\dlr$, which is the lower-right
triangle shaded in red.  In this triangle, $y \lt x/2$ (as used above in
Example 2) which means that for this example, we must use $x > 2y$.</p>

<p>The double integral is similar to the first way of computing Example
1, with the only difference being that the lower limit of $x$ is
$2y$.  The integral is
\begin{align*}
  \iint_\dlr x y^2 dA &amp;= \int_0^1 \left(
  \int_{2y}^2 xy^2 dx \right)dy\\
  &amp;= \int_0^1\left(\left.\frac{x^2y^2}{2} \right|_{x=2y}^{x=2}\right)
  dy\\
  &amp;= \int_0^1 \left( 2y^2 - \frac{(2y)^2 y^2}{2}\right) dy\\
  &amp;= \int_0^1 \left( 2y^2 - 2y^4\right) dy\\
 &amp;= 2 \left[ \frac{y^3}{3} - \frac{y^5}{5}
  \right]_0^1\\
  &amp;= 2 \left(\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{5} -(0-0)\right)\\
  &amp;= 2 \cdot \frac{2}{15} \goodbreak = \frac{4}{15}.
\end{align*}
Thankfully, this does agree with the answer we obtained in Example 2.
