<h4>Ordinary derivatives in one-variable calculus</h4>

<p>Your heating bill depends on the average temperature outside.  If all
other factors remain constant, then the heating bill will increase
when temperatures drop.  Let's denote average temperature by $T$, and
define a function $h : \R \to \R$ {% confusedlink "function_notation" %} so that $h(T)$ gives the heating
bill as a function of $T$.</p>

<p>We can then interpret the ordinary derivative (i.e., the derivative
you learned about in first semester calculus) as indicating how much
the heating bill will change as you change the temperature:
\begin{align*}
  \diff{h}{T}(a) = \frac{\text{change in $h$}}{\text{change in $T$}}
  (\text{ at $T=a$}).
\end{align*}
If we graph $h$ as a function of $T$, then $\displaystyle
\diff{h}{T}(a)$ gives the slope of the graph at the point where $T=a$.
We say that $\displaystyle \diff{h}{T}$ is the derivative of $h$ with
respect to $T$.  If $T$ is given in degrees Celsius, then
$\displaystyle \diff{h}{T}(a)$ is change in heating cost per degree
Celsius of temperature increase when the temperature is $a$.  Since
$h$ decreases as $T$ increases, we expect $\displaystyle \diff{h}{T}$
to be negative.  (The rate of change in heating cost per degree of
Celsius of temperature <b>decrease</b> is positive.  But this
positive rate is equal to $\displaystyle -\diff{h}{T}$.)
</p>

<p>Although I don't know what $h(T)$ should really look like, pretend it
looks like the curve graphed in the below applet.   We
can visualize the derivative by drawing a line tangent to
the curve at a point $(a,h(a))$.  The slope of the line is equal to
the slope of the graph when $T=a$; hence, the slope of the line is
equal to the derivative $\displaystyle \diff{h}{T}(a)$.</p>

<h4>Partial derivatives are analogous to ordinary derivatives</h4>

<p>Clearly, writing the heating bill as a function of temperature is a
gross oversimplification.  The heating bill will depend on other
factors, not least of which is the amount of insulation in your house,
which we'll denote by $I$.  We can define a new function $h : \R^2 \to
\R$ so that $h(T,I)$ gives the heating bill as function of both
temperature $T$ and insulation $I$.</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe this function would look something like the below graph.</p>

{% boxedapplet "heating_cost_temperature_insulation" %}

<p>Suppose you aren't changing the amount of insulation in your house, so
that we view $I$ as a fixed number.  Then, if we look at how the
heating bill changes as temperature changes, we're back to our first
case above.  The only difference is that we now view $h$ as a function
of both $T$ and $I$, and we are explicitly leaving one of the
variables ($I$) constant.  In this case, we call the change in $h$ the
<i>partial derivative</i> of $h$ with respect to $T$, a term that
reflects the fact some variables remain constant. We also change our
notation by writing the $d$ as a $\partial$, so that
\begin{align*}
  \pdiff{h}{T}(a,b) =  \frac{\text{change in $h$}}{\text{change in $T$}}
  (\text{at $T=a$ while holding $I$ constant at $b$}).
\end{align*}
If $T$ is given in degrees Celsius, then $\displaystyle
\pdiff{h}{T}(a,b)$ is change in heating cost per degree Celsius of
temperature increase when the outside temperature is $a$ and the
amount of insulation is $b$.</p>

<p>Now, imagine you are considering the possibility of lowering your heating
bill by installing additional insulation.  To help you decide if it
will be worth your money, you may want to know how much adding
insulation will decrease the heating bill, assuming the temperature
remains constant.  In other words, you want to know the partial
derivative of $h$ with respect to $I$:
\begin{align*}
  \pdiff{h}{I}(a,b) =  \frac{\text{change in $h$}}{\text{change in $I$}}
  (\text{at $I=b$ while holding $T$ constant at $a$}).
\end{align*}
If $I$ is given in centimeters of insulation, then $\displaystyle
\pdiff{h}{I}(a,b)$ is change in heating cost per added centimeter of
insulation when the outside temperature is $a$ and the amount of
insulation is $b$.</p>


<p>The partial derivative $\displaystyle \pdiff{h}{I}$ indicates how much
effect additional insulation will have on the heating bill.  Since
additional insulation will presumably lower the heating bill,
$\displaystyle \pdiff{h}{I}$ will be negative.  If additional
insulation will have a large effect, then $\displaystyle \pdiff{h}{I}$
will be a large, negative number.   If, for your house, $\displaystyle
\pdiff{h}{I}$ is large and negative, you may be inclined to add
insulation to save money.</p>

<p>In the graph of $h(T,I)$, the partial derivatives can be viewed as the
slopes of the graphs in the $T$ direction and in the $I$ direction,
as illustrated in the below applet. </p>

{% boxedapplet "partial_derivatives_heating_cost" %}


<p>You can drag the change the values of $T$ and $I$ to
see, for example, how the partial derivative $\displaystyle
\pdiff{h}{I}$ depends on both temperature and insulation.
Consequently, your decision to add insulation will be affected by what
temperatures you expect and how much insulation your home has already.
You might expect that additional insulation will have a larger effect
(i.e., $\displaystyle \pdiff{h}{I}$ will be larger negative number)
for lower temperatures and smaller amounts of insulation.  So if you
live in some cold place in Minnesota, USA, and have an old, poorly insulated house, it's likely
that $\displaystyle \pdiff{h}{I}$ will be a very large, negative
number so that adding a moderate amount of insulation could
dramatically decrease your heating bill.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, a heating bill depends on many more factors than
temperature and insulation.  We could define a function $h$ of many
variables to give a more accurate estimate of heating costs.  However,
the math is the same no matter how many variables $h$ depends on, as
long as it depends on two or more.  So, if you want to include the
effect of the size $S$ of a house, you can define $h(T,I,S)$ to be the
heating bill as a function of temperature, insulation, and size.  Then
$\displaystyle \pdiff{h}{S}(T,I,S)$ would tell you how much the
heating costs change as you change the size, leaving temperature and
insulation constant.  (We can still make sense of these partial
derivatives even if we cannot plot a graph of $h(T,I,S)$.)  
The value of $\displaystyle
\pdiff{h}{S}$ would presumably be useful only if you are planning to move since
you probably don't plan to cut a room off your house to save heating
costs (though you could just not heat a room and effectively
reduce the size).</p>

  <h4>Slope in arbitrary directions</h4>
  
  <p>The partial derivatives of a function $f(\vc{x})$ give the 
    slopes of the function when you move in directions parallel 
    to the coordinate axis, i.e., when you keep all variables fixed
    except one.  What if you move in a diagonal direction, such as
    increasing both $x$ and $y$ at the same time for a function $f(x,y)$?
    To measure slopes in arbitrary directions, you need the
    {% intlink "directional_derivative_gradient_introduction" %}directional
    derivative{%endintlink%}, a generalization of the partial derivative
    to the slope in the direction of any {% intlink "unit_vector_definition" %}unit vector{%endintlink%} $\vc{u}$.</p>
