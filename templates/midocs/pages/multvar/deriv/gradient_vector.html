{% title "The gradient vector" %}
{% description "The gradient vector is the matrix of partial derivatives of a scalar valued function viewed as a vector." %}

<p>The {%intlink derivative_matrix %}matrix of partial derivatives{%endintlink%} of a scalar-valued function, $f: \R^n \to \R$ {% confusedlink function_notation %}, is a $1 \times n$ row matrix:
\begin{gather*}
\jacm f(\vc{x}) = \left[ \pdiff{f}{x_1}(\vc{x}) \quad \pdiff{f}{x_2}(\vc{x}) \quad \cdots \quad \pdiff{f}{x_n}(\vc{x}) \right].
\end{gather*}
Normally, we don't view a vector as such a row matrix.
When we write  {%intlink matrix_introduction vectors_as_matrices%}vectors as matrices{%endintlink%}, we tend to write an $n$-dimensional vector vector as $n \times 1$ column matrix.  But, in this case, we'll make an exception, and view this derivative matrix as a vector, called the gradient of $f$ and denoted as $\nabla f$:
$$\nabla f(\vc{x}) =  \left(\pdiff{f}{x_1}(\vc{x}), \pdiff{f}{x_2}(\vc{x}), \cdots, \pdiff{f}{x_n}(\vc{x}) \right).$$
</p>

<p>We emphasize that the gradient vector is defined only for scalar-valued functions.  For vector valued functions, we will stick with viewing the derivative as a matrix.</p>

<h4>Why view the derivative as a vector?</h4>
<p>Viewing the derivative as the gradient vector is useful in a number of contexts.  The geometric view of the derivative as a vector with a length and direction helps in understading the properties of the {% intlink directional_derivative_gradient_introduction%}directional derivative{%endintlink%}. </p>

<p>In another context, we can think of the gradient as a function $\nabla f: \R^n \to \R^n$, which can be viewed as a special type of {%intlink vector_field_overview%}vector field{%endintlink%}.  
When one takes {% intlink line_integral_vector_field_introduction%}line integrals{%endintlink%} of this vector field, one discovers the line integral is 
{%intlink conservative_vector_field_introduction %}path-independent{%endintlink%}, the central idea of the {%intlink gradient_theorem_line_integrals%}gradient theorem for line integrals{%endintlink%}.</p>
