<h4>Review limit definition</h4>

<p>Recall that the {% intlink partial_derivative_introduction %}partial derivative{%endintlink%} of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x$
at the point $(a,b)$ is the same thing as the ordinary derivative of
the function $g(x)=f(x,b)$:
\begin{align*}
  \pdiff{f}{x}(a,b) = g'(a).
\end{align*}
(Here we think of $b$ as just a constant.)
We illustrate this graphically as follows.  </p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "partial_derivative_as_slope" %}</p>

<p>The green curve can be viewed as the function $g(x)$ and the black
line is tangent to the green curve.</p>

<p>You may recall from one-variable calculus how the ordinary derivative
was defined.  It was with the nice formula
\begin{align*}
  g'(a) = \diff{g}{x}(a) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{g(a+h)-g(a)}{h}.
  \label{eq:limitdef}
\end{align*}
You can use the the below applet to refresh your memory.

<p>To understand the formula for the slope of the blue line through the red and black points, note that the height of the red point is $g(a+h)$ and the height of the black point is $g(a)$.  Therefore, the &ldquo;rise&rdquo; between those points is $g(a+h)-g(a)$. 
The &ldquo;run&rdquo; between the points is $h$. 
Rise over run is gives the slope of the line
\begin{align*}
  \frac{g(a+h)-g(a)}{h}
\end{align*}
As $h$ approaches zero, this expression approaches the
above definition of the derivative $g'(a)$.  Hence, the
slope of the blue line approaches the derivative $g'(a)$. 
</p>

<p>
Since
\begin{align*}
  \pdiff{f}{x}(a,b) = g'(a)
\end{align*}
we can apply the limit defintion of $g'(a)$ to conclude that 
\begin{align*}
  \pdiff{f}{x}(a,b) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a+h,b) -
    f(a,b)}{h}.
  \label{eq:limitdefx}
\end{align*}
In a similar manner, we define
\begin{align*}
  \pdiff{f}{y}(a,b) = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a,b+h) -
    f(a,b)}{h}.
  \label{eq:limitdefy}
\end{align*}
</p>

<h4>Example with limit definition</h4>
 
<p>Define $f(x,y)$ by
\begin{align*}
  f(x,y) =
  \begin{cases}
    \displaystyle \frac{x^3 +x^4-y^3}{x^2+y^2}
    &amp; \text{if } (x,y) \ne (0,0)\\
    0 &amp; \text{if } (x,y) = (0,0)
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
If we want to calculate the partial derivative of $f(x,y)$ at any
point away from the origin $(0,0)$, we can use the usual formulas.
However, if we want to calculate $\displaystyle \pdiff{f}{x}(0,0)$, we
have to use the definition of the partial derivative.  (There are no
formulas that apply at points around which a function definition is
broken up in this way.)</p>

<p>So, we plug in the above limit definition for $\pdiff{f}{x}$.  We use the fact
that $f(0,0)=0$ and 
\begin{align*}
  f(h,0) =  \frac{h^3+h^4-0^3}{h^2+0^2} = \frac{h^3+h^4}{h^2} = h+h^2.
\end{align*}
Then,
\begin{align*}
  \pdiff{f}{x}(0,0) &amp;=
  \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(0+h,0)-f(0,0)}{h}\\
   &amp;=
  \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(h,0)-f(0,0)}{h}\\
  &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} 
  \frac{\displaystyle h+h^2-0}{h}\\
  &amp;= \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}
  1+h\\
  &amp;=1.
\end{align*}

<p>This partial derivative is illustrated by a tangent line of slope 1 in the below applet.</p>
