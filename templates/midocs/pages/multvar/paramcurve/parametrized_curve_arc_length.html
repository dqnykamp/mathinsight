{% title "The arc length of a parametrized curve" %}
{% description "Introduction to the arc length of a parametrized curve. The arc length definition is illustrated with interactive graphics." %}


<p>A vector-valued function of a single variable,
$\dllp: \R \to \R^n$ {% confusedlink function_notation %}, can be viewed as
{%intlink parametrized_curve_introduction %}parametrizing a
curve{%endintlink%}.
Such a function $\dllp(t)$ traces out a curve as you vary
$t$.</p>

<p>You could think of a curve $\dllp : \R \to \R^3$ as being a wire.  For
example, $\dllp(t) = (\cos t, \sin t, t)$, for $0 \le t \le 6\pi$, is
the parametrization of a helix.  You can view it as a slinky or a spring.</p>

{%boxedapplet parametrized_helix %}


<p>Imagine we wanted to estimate the length of the slinky, 
which we call the <i>arc length</i> of the parametrized curve.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to calculate the length of a curved piece
of wire.  It's much easier to calculate the length of straight pieces of
wire.  Probably the easiest way to calculate the length of the slinky
would be to stretch it out into one straight line.  But, if you ever
tried to do that with a slinky (or a strong spring), you'd discover
that stretching it into a straight line is virtually impossible.</p>

<p>If you can't stretch the slinky into one straight line, what could
you do to estimate its length?  One thing you could do is pretend that
the slinky, rather than being a curved wire, was really composed of a
bunch of short straight wires.  In other words, you could approximate
the curved slinky with line segments.<p>

{% boxedapplet helix_arc_length %}


<p>The length of the line segments is easy to measure.  If you add up the
lengths of all the line segments, you'll get an estimate of the length
of the slinky.  Let $\Delta t$ specify the discretization interval
of the line segments, and denote the total length of the line
segments by $L(\Delta t)$.  (In the above applet, $\Delta t$ is written
as $dt$.)  As the line segments take shortcuts, 
the length of the line segments underestimate the arc length of the slinky.</p>

<p>However, if you increase the number of line segments (decreasing the
length of each line segment), the total length of the line segments
becomes a better estimate of the slinky arc length.  
As $\Delta t$ approaches zero, the length of
each line segment shrinks toward zero, the number of line segments
increases, and the line segments become closer and closer to the
slinky.  Consequently, the total length $L(\Delta t)$ of the line segments
approaches the slinky arc length.</p>

<p>What's the length of each line segment?  If there are $n$ line
segments, we could define $t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_n$ so that the first
line segment goes from the point $\dllp(t_0)$ to the point
$\dllp(t_1)$, the second line segment goes from the point $\dllp(t_1)$
to the point $\dllp(t_2)$, etc.  The vector from $\dllp(t_0)$
to $\dllp(t_1)$ is simply $\dllp(t_1)  - \dllp(t_0)$, so the length of the
line segment must be $\| \dllp(t_1)  - \dllp(t_0) \|$.  The length of
the second line segment is $\| \dllp(t_2)  - \dllp(t_1) \|$, etc.</p>

<p>To find the total length
of the line segments, we just add up those lengths from all $n$ line segments:
\begin{align*}
  \sum_i^n \| \dllp(t_i) - \dllp(t_{i-1})\|.
  \label{totallengtha}
\end{align*}
</p>


<p>Now we do some tricks to put this into a different form.  First, if
$\Delta t_i = t_i - t_{i-1}$, then we can rewrite $t_{i}$ as $t_{i-1} +
\Delta t_i$.  Next, we can divide each term of the above equation 
by $\Delta t_i$ and multiply it by $\Delta t_i$
so that our expression for the length becomes
\begin{align}
  \sum_i^n \| \dllp(t_i) - \dllp(t_{i-1})\|
  &amp;=
  \sum_i^n \| \dllp(t_{i-1} + \Delta t_i) - \dllp(t_{i-1})\|
  \notag
  \\
  &amp;=  \sum_i^n
  \left\| \frac{\dllp(t_{i-1} + \Delta t_i) - \dllp(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t_i}\right\|
  \Delta t_i.
  \label{total_length}
\end{align}
</p>

<p>Maybe this new equation doesn't look like much of an
improvement.  But if you were a real
math nerd, you might have noticed that the quotient involving
$\dllp(t_{i-1})$ is exactly the expression used in the
{%intlink parametrized_curve_derivative limit_definition %}limit 
definition of the derivative{%endintlink%} $\dllp'(t)$ of a parametrized curve 
(if we replace $h$ with $\Delta t_i$).  
In fact, equation \eqref{total_length}
is a Riemann sum for an integral, analogous to the ones used to define
integrals such as
{%intlink double_integral_introduction%}double integrals{%endintlink%}.
If we let the number of line
segments increase (as we take the limit $\Delta t_i \to 0$) the
quotient becomes $\dllp'(t)$, and 
equation \eqref{total_length}
approaches the integral
\begin{align*}
  L(\dllp)=\int_a^b \| \dllp'(t) \| dt,
  \label{totallengthc}
\end{align*}
which is the true arc length of the slinky.  The numbers $a$ and $b$ are
the values of $t$ at the ends of the slinky (i.e., the numbers so that
the slinky is defined by $\dllp(t)$ for $a \le t \le b$).  In our
example, the slinky was defined by $\dllp(t)$ for $0 \le t \le 6\pi$,
so we would use $a=0$ and $b=6\pi$.
</p>


<p>The magnitude of the derivative $\| \dllp'(t) \|$ is the 
{% intlink parametrized_curve_derivative_location_velocity %}speed of a
particle{%endintlink%} that is at position $\dllp(t)$ at time $t$. 
The above equation simply says that the total length of the curve
traced by the particle is the integral of its speed.  (This length
must, of course, be 
{%intlink parametrized_curve_arc_length_examples lengthind%}independent of the particle's speed{%endintlink%}.)</p>
