{% description "The derivative of the vector-valued function parameterizing a curve is shown to be a vector tangent to the curve." %}

<p>The derivative of a vector-valued function is the
{% intlink derivative_matrix %}matrix of partial derivatives{%endintlink%}.
For vector-valued functions of a single variable,
$\dllp: \R \to \R^n$ {% confusedlink function_notation %}, this matrix is an $n \times 1$
column matrix, which each component is the derivative 
of a component of $\dllp$ with respect to that single variable.
Since the matrix has only one column, we could view it as a vector.
For example, if $\dllp(t)$ had three components, we could write the 
derivative as
\begin{align*}
  D\dllp(t) = 
  \left[
  \begin{array}{c}
  \diff{\dllpc_1}{t}(t)\\
  \diff{\dllpc_2}{t}(t)\\
  \diff{\dllpc_3}{t}(t)
  \end{array}
  \right]
  = (\dllpc_1'(t),\dllpc_2'(t),\dllpc_3'(t))
  =\dllp'(t).
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>We could also have equivalently defined the derivative 
using the limit definition that we use in one-variable.
This definition will be useful for obtaining a 
geometric interpretation of the derivative 
as a derivative of the curve parametrized by the vector-valued function.</p>

<p>The limit definition of the derivative is
<a id="limit_definition"></a>
\begin{align*}
  \dllp'(t) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}
  \frac{\dllp(t+h) - \dllp(t)}{h}.
\end{align*}
In one-variable calculus, the derivative was the slope of the graph.
Is this true for parametrized curves?  In this case, the
derivative is a vector, so it can't just be the slope (which is a
scalar).  Instead, the derivative $\dllp'(t)$ is the tangent vector
of the curve traced by $\dllp(t)$.  In this way, the direction of the
derivative $\dllp'(t)$ specifies the slope of the curve traced by
$\dllp(t)$.  The length (or magnitude) of the derivative
$\|\dllp'(t)\|$ specifies how fast $\dllp(t)$ traces out the curve as
you change $t$.
</p>

<p>The below applet illustrates why the derivative defined by the limit defintion
is tangent to the curve.
We could denote the estimate of the derivative shown by the red arrow as
\begin{align*}
  \vc{g}_h(t) =   \frac{\dllp(t+h) - \dllp(t)}{h}.
\end{align*}
Note that $\vc{g}_h(t)$ is defined so that 
\begin{align*}
  \lim_{h \to 0} \  \vc{g}_h(t) = \dllp'(t).  
\end{align*}
</p>

{% boxedapplet derivative_parametrized_curve %}

<p>
For any value of $t$, you can see that when $h=1$, then $\vc{g}_h(t) =
\dllp(t+h) - \dllp(t)$ (since the red vector joins the heads of
the blue and green vectors).  
As you move $h$ toward zero, the red vector approaches the tangent of
the ellipse.  When $h$ is zero, the blue and green vectors are
identical.  In this limit, the red vector is the derivative
$\dllp'(t)$ and is tangent to the ellipse.
</p>

<p>
We can use the fact that $\dllp'(t)$ is tangent to the curve
$\dllp(t)$ to calculate the equation for
{% intlink parametrized_curve_tangent_line %}the tangent line to a
curve{%endintlink%}.</p>
