{% title "An introduction to parametrized curves" %}
{% description "An introduction to how a vector-valued function of a single variable can be viewed as parametrizing a curve. Interactive graphics illustrate the way in which the function maps an interval onto a curve." %}

<p>A simple way to visualize a scalar-valued function of one or two variables
is through their graphs.  In a graph, you plot the domain and range
of the function on the same set of axes, so the value of the function
for a value of its input can be immediately read off the graph.  
Whether you plot the function $f(x)$ by the curve of points $(x,f(x))$
or the function $f(x,y)$ by the surface of points $(x,y,f(x,y))$, 
these graphs give a fairly comprehensive view of the behavior of the function.
</p>

<p>If we have a two-dimensional vector-valued function of a single variable,
$\vc{f}: \R \to \R^2$ {% confusedlink function_notation %}, it is still possible to display its graph.
If the function is $\vc{f}(t)=(f_1(t),f_2(t))$, we could plot the set of
points $(t,f_1(t),f_2(t))$ and obtain a curve in three-dimensional space.</p>

<p>For example, the graph of the function
$\dllp(t)=(3\cos t)\vc{i} + (2 \sin t) \vc{j}$
is a spiral, or helix, as shown here.</p>

{% boxedapplet "parametrized_ellipse_graph" %}

<p>Graphing a vector valued function is possible for functions 
$\vc{f}: \R \to \R^2$ because the graph required only three dimensions.
However, we are unable to plot the graph with an higher-dimensional
input or output space, as these graphs would require more than three
dimensions.
We need a new method to visualize these functions.</p>

<p>One way to visualize vector-valued functions is by 
choosing a set in their domain and viewing how the function 
maps this set into its range. 
This procedure is particularly effective for vector-valued functions
of a single variable.  
We pick an interval in their domain, and these functions
will map that interval into a curve.
If the function is two or three-dimensional, we can easily
plot these curves to visualize the behavior of the function.</p>

<p>Returning to the example function 
$\dllp(t)=(3\cos t)\vc{i} + (2 \sin t) \vc{j}$,
you can see in the below applet how it maps the interval $[0,2\pi]$ 
into an ellipse.
As $t$ sweeps through the interval $[0,2\pi]$, the vector $\dllp(t)$
sweeps out the ellipse.  
We refer to $t$ as a free parameter,
and say that $\dllp$ parametrizes the ellipse.
(You can see the {% appletlink "parametrized_ellipse" %} applet's page{% endappletlink%} for details on how to show that $\dllp$ indeed
sweeps out a ellipse.)
</p>

{% boxedapplet "parametrized_ellipse" %}

<p>The ellipse is the image of the $[0,2\pi]$ under the mapping $\dllp$.
If we think of $[0,2\pi]$ being being made of rubber,
the function $\dllp$ stretches the rubber and curves it into the ellipse.
Viewing $\dllp(t)$ as parametrizing ellipse hides some of the 
information, as the dependence on the parameter is less obvious.
But, we still retain knowledge of which values of the parameter $t$
correspond to which points of the ellipse.  
To emphasize that we have more than just a curve of points, 
we refer to such curves as <i>parametrized curves</i>. 
</p>

<p>Often we think of the variable $t$ as representing time 
and $\dllp(t)$ as representing position as a function of time.
For example, in the {%intlink chain_rule_multivariable_introduction%}introduction
to the chain rule{%endintlink%}, we used a parametrized curve
to represent position of a hiker climbing a mountain.
We retained the representation of time $t$ so that 
we could calculate how fast the climber ascended.</p>
 
<p>A single image curve, such as the ellipse, could have many
parametrizations.  
For example, we could parametrize the ellipse by the function
$\adllp(t)=(3\cos\frac{t^2}{2\pi})\vc{i} + (2 \sin \frac{t^2}{2\pi}) \vc{j}$,
as shown in the below applet.
This function also maps the interval $[0, 2\pi]$ onto the ellipse.
In this case, the function stretches the interval unevenly
as it curves $[0, 2\pi]$ into the ellipse;
the right end of the interval is greatly stretched while the 
left end of the interval is compressed.
If you change $t$ at a constant speed from 0 to $2\pi$, 
the vector $\adllp(t)$ moves slowly at first and picks up speed
as $t$ increases.</p>

{% boxedapplet "parametrized_ellipse_2" %}

<p>The differences between $\dllp(t)$ and $\adllp(t)$ are not
obvious when looking at the curves they parametrize.  
We could make the difference more obvious by labeling points
along the curve by their corresponding values of $t$.
The difference is much more evident from their graphs; 
compare the following graph $\adllp$ with the graph 
of $\dllp$ at the beginning of this page.</p>

{% boxedapplet "parametrized_ellipse_graph_2" %}

<p>Three-dimensional vector-valued functions can parametrize
curves embedded in three-dimensions.
The function $\sadllp(t) = (3\cos t)\vc{i} + (2 \sin t) \vc{j} + \vc{k}$
parametrizes a helix, as shown below.
This helix looks like the graph of $\dllp$, above. 
But, in this case, we have a mapping from the interval
$[0,2\pi]$ onto the helix, so this is a parametrized helix.
If we wanted to graph $\sadllp$, we would need four dimensions.</p>


{% boxedapplet "parametrized_elliptical_helix" %}

<p>A special case of a parametrized curve is a parametrized line. 
In {% intlink line_parametrization %}this page{%endintlink%},
we introduce a simple parametrization of a line.
But after seeing how we could change the vector-valued function and
still parametrize the same curve, can you think of other
types of vector-valued functions that would parametrize a line?
</p>


<p>The {% intlink parametrized_curve_derivative%}derivative of a parametrized 
curve{%endintlink%} also has special meaning.</p>
