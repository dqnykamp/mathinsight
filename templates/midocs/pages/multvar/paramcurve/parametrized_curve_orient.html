{% description "Orienting curves by choosing a tangent vector." %}

<p>Given a curve $\dlc$ from the point $\vc{p}$ to point $\vc{q}$, 
{% intlink "parametrized_curve_introduction" %}we can parametrize{%endintlink%} $\dlc$ by a function $\dllp(t)$, for $a \le t \le b$.  In
this case, we know that $\dllp(a)= \vc{p}$ and $\dllp(b)= \vc{q}$.
We could say that the curve is {% intlink "oriented_curve_definition" %}oriented{%endintlink%} from $\vc{p}$ to
$\vc{q}$.  At any point $\dllp(t)$ along the curve, you could tell
its orientation by its unit tangent vector
\begin{align*}
  \vc{T} = \frac{\dllp'(t)}{\|\dllp'(t)\|}.
\end{align*}</p>

<p>We could also parametrize the curve backward, going from $\vc{q}$ to
$\vc{p}$, by a function $\tadllp(s)$, for $a \le s \le b$, with
$\tadllp(a)=\vc{q}$ and $\tadllp(b) = \vc{p}$.  We could say that the
curve parametrized by $\tadllp$ has the opposite orientation as the
curve parametrized by $\dllp$.  You could tell this by looking at the
unit tangent vector at the point $\tadllp(s)$:
\begin{align*}
   \vc{T} = \frac{\tadllp'(s)}{\|\tadllp'(s)\|}.
\end{align*}
For the same point on the curve, i.e., a $t_0$ and an $s_0$ where $\dllp(t_0)=\tadllp(s_0)$, the two unit tangent vectors would point in
the opposite directions, as shown below.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "parametrized_curve_two_orientations" %}</p>

<p>We speak of orienting curves even without reference to a particular
parametrization.  Choosing an orientation of a curve is equivalent to choosing
one of the two unit tangent vectors.
