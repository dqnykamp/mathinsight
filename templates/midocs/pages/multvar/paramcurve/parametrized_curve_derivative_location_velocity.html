<p>A vector-valued function of a single variable
$\dllp: \R^n \to \R$ {% confusedlink "function_notation" %} can be viewed as a 
{% intlink "parametrized_curve_introduction" %}parametrization of a curve{%endintlink%}
and that its {% intlink "parametrized_curve_derivative" %}derivative{%endintlink%}
is tangent to the curve.
We can think of $t$ as time and the parametrization $\dllp(t)$ as
being the position of an object at time $t$.  The curve parametrized
by $\dllp(t)$ is the trajectory of the particle.</p>

<p>For example, the function $\dllp(t) = (\cos t, \sin t)$ is a
parametrization of the unit circle.</p>

<p>The parametrization, though, has more information that simply the
circle.  It gives the location of the particle moving around the
circle, where the particle finishes each trip in $t=2\pi$ seconds (or
minutes, or hours, or whatever units we use for time $t$).  The
following animation illustrates this motion.</p>

<p>It looks as if the speed of the particle is constant.  We can show
analytically that this is true.  If $\dllp(t)$ represents the
location of a particle at time $t$, the the velocity of the particle
is $\dllp(t) = \dllp'(t)$, the derivative of $\dllp$.  For our
example, $\dllp(t) = (\cos t, \sin t)$, and the velocity is $\vc{v}(t) =
\dllp'(t) = (-\sin t, \cos t)$.</p>

<p>Velocity is a little different than speed.  Speed is just a number
representing how fast a particle is moving.  Velocity is a vector
whose length represents speed, and whose direction represents the
direction the particle is moving at that specific instance of time.
We can add the velocity vector to our animation.</p>

<p>It certainly looks as if the length of the velocity vector is
constant, which would confirm that the speed of the particle is
constant.  In fact, we can show this algebraically.  You should find
the length of the tangent vector $\vc{v}(t)$ on paper and show that it
is constant -- it does not depend on t.</p>

<p>Let's look at a different parametrization of the unit circle,
$\adllp(t) = (\cos(t^2), \sin(t^2))$,    $0 \le t \le \sqrt{2\pi}.$</p>

<p>This is a parametrization of the unit circle because as $t$ ranges
from $0$ to $\sqrt{2\pi}$, $t^2$ ranges from 0 to $2\pi$.  Let's watch
the particle whose motion is represented by $\adllp(t)$.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "parametrization_circle_4" %}</p>

<p>As you can see, the particle starts out very slowly and picks up speed
as time goes on.  You can see this either by watching the particle
itself, or by watching the length of the tangent vector grow.
(Remember, the length of the tangent vector represents the speed of
the particle!) Find the velocity of this particle and see if you can
explain what you're seeing.</p>
