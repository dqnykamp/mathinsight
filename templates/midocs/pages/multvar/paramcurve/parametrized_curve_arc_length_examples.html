<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>Write a parameterization for the straight-line path from the
point (1,2,3) to the point (3,1,2).  Find the arc length.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "line_segment_path" %}</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>:
The vector from (1,2,3) to (3,1,2) is
$\vc{d} = (3,1,2)-(1,2,3) = (2,-1,-1)$.  We can parametrize the
line segment by 
\begin{align*}
  \dllp(t) = (1,2,3) + t (2,-1,-1), \qquad 0 \le t \le 1
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
To find arc length, we calculate
\begin{align*}
  \dllp'(t) &amp;=  (2,-1,-1)\\
  \| \dllp'(t)\| &amp;= \sqrt{2^2+(-1)^2 + (-1)^2}
  = \sqrt{6}\\
\end{align*}
Therefore, the length of the line segment is
\begin{align*}
  \int_a^b \| \dllp'(t)\| dt
  = \int_0^1 \sqrt{6} dt = \sqrt{6}
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>Clearly, it was silly to calculate the length this way.  We knew the
length of the line segment must be $\| \vc{d} \| = \sqrt{6}$.  But,
this simply illustrates the method of calculating arc length of 
parametrized curves.</p>


{% navigation_tag "example2" "Examples" "Example 2" %}
<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Another parameterization for the line segment of example 1 is
\begin{align*}
  \adllp(t) = (1,2,3) + (e^t-1) (2,-1,-1), \quad
  0 \le t \le \log 2.
\end{align*}
Find the length of the line segment using this parametrization.</p>

<p>It might not be obvious that $\adllp$ parametrizes the same line segment
as $\dllp$ from example 1.
To see this fact, notice that
$(e^t-1)$ is zero when $t=0$, and it is 1 when $t=\log 2$.  Indeed, a
particle with position $\adllp(t)$ at time $t$ does move along the
straight line from (1,2,3) to (3,1,2) as $t$ goes from 0 to $\log
2$.  It just doesn't move at a constant speed.  You can read about
{% intlink "parametrized_curve_derivative_location_velocity" %}another
example{%endintlink%} where particles move along the same curve but at different speeds.
</p>


<p><b>Solution</b>:  We simply use the definition of arc length to
find the length of the line segment using using this
parameterization.  We calculate
\begin{align*}
  \adllp'(t) &amp;= e^t (2,-1,-1)\\
  \|\adllp'(t)\| &amp;= e^t \|(2,-1,-1)\|
  = e^t \sqrt{6},
\end{align*}
so the arc length is
\begin{align*}
  \int_a^b \| \adllp'(t)\| dt &amp;= \int_0^{\log 2}
  e^t \sqrt{6} dt\\
  &amp;= \sqrt{6} (e^{\log 2}- e^0)\\
  &amp;= \sqrt{6} (2-1) = \sqrt{6},
\end{align*}
which agrees with example 1.</p>

<p>Examples 1 and 2 illustrate an important principle.  The length of a curve does not depend on its parametrization.  Of course, this makes
sense, as the distance a particle travels along a particular route
doesn't depend on its speed.</p>

{% navigation_tag "example3" "Examples" "Example 3" %}
<h4>Example 3</h4>

<p>Find the arc length of the helix parametrized by
$\dllp(t) = (\cos t, \sin t, t)$ for $0 \le t \le 6\pi$.  (This was
the example used in the {% intlink "parametrized_curve_arc_length" %}introduction
to arc length{%endintlink%}.)</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>:  We calculate
\begin{align*}
  \dllp'(t) &amp;= (-\sin t, \cos t, 1)\\
  \|\dllp'(t)\| &amp;= \sqrt{\sin^2 t +  \cos^2 t +  1^2} = \sqrt{2}.
\end{align*}
The length is
\begin{align*}
  \int_0^{6\pi} \sqrt{2} dt = \left.\left.\sqrt{2}
  t\right|_0^{6\pi}\right. = 6\sqrt{2} \pi
  \approx 26.7.
\end{align*}
