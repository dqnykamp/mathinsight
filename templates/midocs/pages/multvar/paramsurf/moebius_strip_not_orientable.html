{% description "Explanation why a Möbius strip cannot be oriented by choosing a normal vector to point to one side." %}

<p>A {%intlink parametrized_surface_orient %}surface is orientable{%endintlink%} if it has two sides.  Then,
one can orient the surface by choosing one side to be the {% intlink positive_side_definition %}positive
side{%endintlink%}.

<p>Some unusual surfaces however are not orientable because they have
only one side.  One classical examples is called the
{% extlink "http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/moebius.shtml" %}Möbius strip{%endextlink%}.  You
can construct a Möbius strip by taking a strip of paper, twisting it
half a turn, and then taping the ends together.  A Möbius strip with
a normal vector is shown below.</p>
