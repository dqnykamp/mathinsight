{% description "How to calculate the normal vector from the parametrization of a surface." %}

<p>To {% intlink "parametrized_surface_area_calculation" %}calculate the surface area{%endintlink%} of a {% intlink "parametrized_surface_introduction" %}parametrized surface{%endintlink%}, we approximated each small segment
of the surface as a parallelogram spanned by $\displaystyle
\pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}(\spfv,\spsv)\Delta \spfv$ and $\displaystyle \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}(\spfv,\spsv)
\Delta \spsv$.  To find the area of the parallelogram, we took the
magnitude of their cross product.</p>

<p>One feature of the {% intlink "cross_product" %}cross product{%endintlink%} is that its magnitude is the
area of the parallelogram spanned by the two vectors.  The other
feature of the cross product is that it is perpendicular to both of
the vectors.  It turns out that the vectors $\pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}(\spfv,\spsv)$ and $\pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}(\spfv,\spsv)$ are both
tangent to the surface.  Consequently, their cross product
\begin{align*}
  \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}(\spfv,\spsv) \times
  \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}(\spfv,\spsv)
\end{align*}
is perpendicular to the surface and therefore is a normal vector to
the surface.  We frequently want a unit normal vector, meaning a
normal vector with length one.  To obtain a unit normal vector, we
just divide by its magnitude:
\begin{align*}
    \vc{n} = \frac{\displaystyle \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}(\spfv,\spsv) \times
  \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}(\spfv,\spsv)}{\displaystyle \left\| \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}(\spfv,\spsv) \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}(\spfv,\spsv)
  \right\|}.
\end{align*}</p>
