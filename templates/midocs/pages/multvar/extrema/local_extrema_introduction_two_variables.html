<h4>Review of functions of one variable</h4>

<p>You remember how to find local extrema (maxima or minima) of a single
variable function $f(x)$.  Let's assume $f(x)$ is differentiable.
Then the first step is to find the <b>critical points</b> $x=a$,
where $f\,'(a)=0$.  Just because $f\,'(a)=0$, it does not mean that
$f(x)$ has a local maximum or minimum at $x=a$.  But, at all extrema,
the derivative will be zero, so we know that the extrema must occur at
critical points.</p>

<p>For example, in the graph below, $f(x)$ is plotted by a green line.
The three critical points are marked by colored circles.  The red
circle marks a local maximum and the blue circle marks a local
minimum.  The yellow circle marks a critical point that is neither a
maximum or a minimum.  Even though $f\,'(x)=0$ at the yellow circle,
the yellow circle does not mark a local extremum.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image critical_points_one_variable %}</p>

<p>At each of these critical points, the linear approximation (i.e.,
tangent line) to $f(x)$ is a horizontal line since $f'(a)=0$.  We can
determine if $f$ has a local extremum at $x=a$ by looking at the
secord-order {%intlink taylors_theorem_multivariable_introduction%}Taylor polynomial{%endintlink%}, which for a function of one
variable is
\begin{align*}
  f(x) \approx f(a) + \frac{1}{2} f\,''(a)(x-a)^2,
\end{align*}
since $f\,'(a)=0$.  As long as $f\,''(a) \ne 0$, the Taylor polynomial
says that $f(x)$ looks like the top or bottom of a parabola for $x$
near $a$.  If $f\,''(a)>0$, then $f(x)$ is approximately a parabola
pointing upward and $f$ has a local minimum at $x=a$, as illustrated
by the blue circle, above.  If $f\,''(a) < 0$, then $f(x)$ is
approximately a parabola pointing downward and $f$ has a local maximum
at $x=a$, as illustrated by the red circle, above.  On the other hand,
if $f\,''(a) = 0$, then the second-order Taylor polynomial doesn't
gives us any more information.  At the point $x=a$, $f$ could have a
local maximum, or it could have a local minimum, or it might not even have
a local extremum, as illustrated by the yellow point, above.</p>

<h4>Functions of multiple variables</h4>

<p>If $f(\vc{x})$ is a function of multiple variables, categorizing local
extrema proceeds in an analogous way.  So that we can visualize
$f(\vc{x})$, we look only at the case of two variables,
$\vc{x}=(x,y)$, where we can graph $f(x,y)$ as a surface.  Assuming
$f(x,y)$ is
{%intlink differentiability_multivariable_introduction%}differentiable{%endintlink%},
local extrema can occur only at critical points $(x,y) = (a,b)$, where
the derivative of $f(x,y)$ is zero, i.e., those points $(a,b)$ where
$Df(a,b) = [0 \  0]$.</p>

<p>If $Df(a,b) = [0 \ 0]$, then the linear approximation (i.e,
tangent plane) of $f(x,y)$ at $(a,b)$ is a horizontal plane.  As in
the one-variable case, we can determine if $f$ has a local extremum at
$(a,b)$ by looking at the secord-order {%intlink taylors_theorem_multivariable_introduction%}Taylor polynomial{%endintlink%}.  If we let $(a,b)=\vc{a}$
(remember that $(x,y)=\vc{x}$), then the second-order Taylor
polynomial is
\begin{align*}
  f(\vc{x}) \approx f(\vc{a}) + \frac{1}{2} (\vc{x}-\vc{a})^T
  Hf(\vc{a}) (\vc{x}-\vc{a}).
\end{align*}
All this equation says is that, around $\vc{x}=\vc{a}$, the graph of
$z=f(x,y)$ looks like a quadric surface (unless $Hf(a,b)$ is zero).
In fact, $f(x,y)$ will look like a paraboloid. </p>

<p>Depending on the second derivative matrix $Hf(a,b)$, the graph of
$f(x,y)$ might look like an {% intlink elliptic_paraboloid %}elliptic paraboloid{%endintlink%} pointing upward,
centered at the point $(a,b)$ (shown by the blue dot, below).  In
this case, we say that $Hf(a,b)$ is <b>positive definite</b>, and
$f$ has a local minimum at $(a,b)$.</p>


{% boxedapplet "local_minimum_two_variables" %}

<p>Alternatively, the graph of $f(x,y)$ might look like an elliptic
paraboloid pointing downward, centered at the point $(a,b)$ (shown by
the red dot, below).  In this case, we say that $Hf(a,b)$ is
<b>negative definite</b>, and $f$ has a local maximum at $(a,b)$.</p>

{% boxedapplet "local_maximum_two_variables" %}

<p>There is a third possibility that couldn't happen in the one-variable
case.  The graph of $f(x,y)$ might look like a {%intlink hyperbolic_paraboloid%}hyperbolic paraboloid{%endintlink%}
centered at the point $(a,b)$ (shown by the green dot, below).  In
this case, the graph looks like a local maximum if you move in one
direction (the direction where one's legs would go if one sat on the
saddle) and the graph looks like a local minimum if you move in
another direction (the direction corresponding to the front and back
if one sat on the saddle).  In this case, we say that $Hf(a,b)$ is
<b>indefinite</b>, and $f$ has neither a local maximum nor a local
minimum at the critical point.  Such a critical point is called a
saddle point.</p>

{% boxedapplet "saddle_point_two_variables" %}

<p>There are other cases, which correspond to the yellow point in the
one-variable case, above.  These are cases where one cannot tell from
the second-order Taylor polynomial if $f$ has a local maximum, a local
minimum, or neither at the critical point.  One would have to look at
higher-order terms of the Taylor polynomial to determine the local
behavior of the function.</p>


<p>{% intlink local_extrema_examples_two_variables %}Here{%endintlink%} are some examples
(which assume knowledge of determining the definiteness of $Hf(a,b)$
that is not discussed in this page.)</p>
