{% title "Math 2374 introduction to Math Insight" %}
{% description "Introduction describing how the Math Insight pages fit into the Math 2374 course." %}

<p>We include the <a href="{% url 'mithreads-thread' 'math2374' %}">Math 2374
thread</a> of Math Insight as an integral part of Math 2374.  These
assigned pages are designed to make lectures more efficient, and we
hope, more useful to you.  Since we design the lectures assuming you've
read these pages, we can spend more time in lecture helping you
understand and apply the material and less time on simply presenting
theory.</p>

<p>As you'll soon discover, this course is extremely fast-paced.  We meet
in lecture only twice a week, but we cover the same amount of material
as if we met three times.  A frequent criticism is that the lectures
are too heavy on theory and too light on application.  These pages
are one way to make sure applications don't get scrimped.</p>


<h4>A lecture, not a textbook</h4>

<p>View these pages more like a lecture than a textbook.  They are not
a replacement for a mathematics textbook because they don't cover all
the theoretical details behind the main ideas.  For the same reason,
they should be easier to understand than a textbook.  we hope you can
read them and make sense out of them in your first reading.  If you
encounter explanations that are confusing, please let your lecturer 
or the responsible <a href="{% url 'mi-contact' %}">Math Insight author</a>
know.
</p>

<h4>Why you should read these pages</h4>

<p>Believe it or not, the Math Insight pages are not designed to give
you yet one more thing to do for this course.  The reason for these pages is help you with the
main work of the course: the homework.  If you read the selected Math Insight
pages before lecture, we can spend more of the lecture on applications
that will shed light on how to attack the homework (and exam)
problems.  We can do this only if you do your part in reading before
lecture. To give you added incentive, we include some homework problems
that are based on the upcoming week's Math Insight pages.
</p>

<h4>Organization of the 2374 thread</h4>

<p>The  <a href="{% url 'mithreads-thread' 'math2374' %}">Math 2374
thread</a> is grouped into parts, and you will be typically
assigned one part for each lecture.  In each part, the required
&ldquo;pre-lecture&rdquo; pages appear marked with an asterisk *.  
After reading those pages, you will be ready to answer the corresponding
question(s) on the homework.
The pre-lecture pages and homework problems cover material from the upcoming
lecture.  </p>

<p>The remaining pages in the Math 2374 thread give more detail or
background to the introduction of the pre-lecture material.
Some may be more understandable after you have attended lecture.</p>



<h4>Feedback</h4>

<p>We apologize in advance for any errors and confusing explanations in the Math Insight pages.
Please <a href="{% url 'mi-contact' %}">alert us to errors and send suggestions</a>.  We continue to make changes to these pages and quizzes based on the
feedback received.</p>
