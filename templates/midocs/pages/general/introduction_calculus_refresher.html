<p>The usual trouble that people have with &lsquo;calculus&rsquo; (not counting general math phobias) is with <b>algebra</b>, not to mention <i>arithmetic</i> and other more elementary things.</p>

<p>Calculus itself just involves two new processes, <i>differentiation</i> and <i>integration</i>, and <i>applications</i> of these new things to solution of problems that would have been impossible otherwise.</p>

<p>Some things which were very important when calculators and computers didnâ€™t exist are not so important now. Some things are just as important. Some things are <i>more</i> important. Some things are important but with a different emphasis.</p>

<p>At the same time, the essential ideas of much of calculus can be very well illustrated without using calculators at all! (Some not, too).</p>

<p>Likewise, many essential ideas of calculus can be very well illustrated without getting embroiled in awful algebra or arithmetic, not to mention trigonometry.</p>

<p>At the same time, study of calculus makes clear how important it is to be <i>able</i> to do the necessary algebra and arithmetic, whether by calculator or by hand.</p>
