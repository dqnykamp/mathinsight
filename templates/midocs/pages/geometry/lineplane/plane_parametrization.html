{% description "Introduction to how one can parametrize a plane. Interactive graphics illustrate basic concepts." %}

<p>A plane {% intlink forming_planes %}is determined by{%endintlink%}
a point $\vc{p}$ in the plane
and two vectors $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$ parallel to the plane.  (This is identical to the case with three
points in the plane.  Why?)</p>

{% boxedapplet plane_three_points %}

<p>From this fact, we can parametrize a plane just like we
{%intlink line_parametrization %}parametrized a line{%endintlink%}
(only we'll need two parameters instead of one).  If
$\vc{x}$ is a point in the plane, the vector from
$\vc{p}$ to $\vc{x}$ (i.e., $\vc{x}-\vc{p}$) is some multiple of
$\vc{a}$ plus some multiple of $\vc{b}$.  (Can you see why?)  We can
express this as $\vc{x}-\vc{p} = s\vc{a} + t\vc{b}$ for $t,s \in
\vc{R}$.  Usually, we'll write this as $\vc{x} = \vc{p} + s\vc{a} + t
\vc{b}$.  The real numbers $s$ and $t$ are the parameters for this
parametrization of the line plane.</p>

<p>The idea of the parametrization is that as the parameters $s$ and $t$
sweep through all real numbers, the point $\vc{x}$ sweeps out the
plane.  In other words, it is a two-dimensional analogue of the
parametrization of the line.  </p>

<p>Here we've added the point $\vc{x}$ in black.
You can't move $\vc{x}$ directly, but you can move it by changing the
parameters $s$ and $t$ (the blue points on sliders).</p>


{% boxedapplet plane_parametrization %}

<p>Clearly, for any value of $s$ and $t$, the point $\vc{x}$ lies on the
plane.  Also, by changing $s$ and $t$, you can move the point $\vc{x}$
to any position on the plane.</p>
