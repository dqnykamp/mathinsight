{% description "A derivation, aided by an interactive graphic, of the formula for the distance from a point to a plane." %}


<p>Here's a quick sketch of how to calculate the distance from a point
$P=(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ to a plane determined by {% intlink normal_vector_definition %}normal vector{%endintlink%}
$\vc{N}=(A,B,C)$ and point $Q=(x_0,y_0,z_0)$.  The {% intlink forming_planes %}equation for the
plane{%endintlink%} determined by $\vc{N}$ and $Q$ is $A(x-x_0)+B(y-y_0) +C(z-z_0) =
0$, which we could write as $Ax+By+Cz+D=0$, where
$D=-Ax_0-By_0-Cz_0$.</p>


<p>This applet demonstrates the setup of the problem and the method we
  will use to derive a formula for the distance from the plane to the
  point $P$.</p>

{% boxedapplet "distance_point_plane" %}

<p>The shortest distance from a point to a plane is along a line
perpendicular to the plane. 
Therefore, the distance from point $P$ to the plane is along a line
parallel to the normal vector, which is shown as a gray line segment.
If we denote by $R$ the point where the gray line segment touches the
plane, then $R$ is the point on the plane closest to $P$.
The distance from $P$ to the plane is the distance from $P$ to $R$.
</p>

<p>To calculate an expression for this distance in terms of the above
quantities defining $P$ and the plane, we first calculate an
expression for a unit normal vector $\vc{n}$, i.e., a normal vector of length one. 
It is simply $\vc{N}$ divided by its length:
\begin{align*}
  \vc{n} = \frac{\vc{N}}{\|\vc{N}\|} = \frac{(A,B,C)}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2+C^2}}.
\end{align*}
The unit normal vector $\vc{n}$ (in green) looks short because in the figure, the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes each extend from $-5$ to 5.</p>

<p>Let $\vc{v}$ be the vector from $Q$ to $P$ (shown in blue).  Since
$P=(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $Q=(x_0,y_0,z_0)$, we calculate that $\vc{v} =
(x_1-x_0, y_1-y_0, z_1-z_0)$.  The length of the gray line, i.e., the
distance from $P$ to the plane, is simply the length of the projection
of $\vc{v}$ onto the unit normal vector $\vc{n}$.  Since $\vc{n}$ is
length one, this distance is simply the absolute value of the {%intlink dot_product %}dot product{%endintlink%} $\vc{v}
\cdot \vc{n}$.  We'll label the distance $d$; it is
<a id="distance_formula_1"></a>
\begin{align*}
  d &amp;= | \vc{v} \cdot \vc{n} |\notag\\
  &amp;= | (x_1-x_0, y_1-y_0, z_1-z_0) \cdot \vc{n} |\notag\\
  &amp;= \frac{| A(x_1-x_0) +B(y_1-y_0) +C(z_1-z_0)|}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2+C^2}}.
\end{align*}
This distance is shown on the cyan slider labeled by $d$ to the right
of the figure.
</p>

<p>Recall that we can also write the equation for the plane as
$Ax+By+Cz+D=0$, with $D=-Ax_0-By_0-Cz_0$.  We'll substitute into the
above formula, to arrive at the following expression for the distance
from $P=(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ to the plane $Ax+By+Cz+D=0$:
<a id="distance_formula_2"></a>
\begin{align*}
  d = \frac{|Ax_1+By_1+Cz_1 +D|}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2+C^2}}.
\end{align*}
From this final formula, you can see that the distance didn't depend
on the point $Q=(x_0,y_0,z_0)$.  As long as $Q$ is in the plane
$Ax+By+Cz+D=0$, then we know that $D=-Ax_0-By_0-Cz_0$.  
The two above formulas for $d$ are equivalent no matter where in the plane $Q$ is.
It's clear from the figure how the distance $d$ shouldn't change as you
move $Q$ around in the plane.  The vector $\vc{v}$ changes, but its
projection onto $\vc{n}$ is constant.
