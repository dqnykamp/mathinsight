<p>In this page, we outline ways to specify a plane.</p>

{% navigation_tag "pointnormal" "Point and normal" %}
<h4>Plane determined by point and normal vector</h4>

<p>Given a point $P$, there are many planes that contain $P$.
However, assuming that we are living in three-dimensional space
($\R^3$), a plane is uniquely determined if we also specify a
normal vector $\vc{n}$ (i.e., a vector that is perpendicular to the
plane). </p>

<p>The following applet illustrates this fact.  You can experiment
with changing the point $P$ and the normal vector $\vc{n}$ and see how
the plane changes.</p>


{% boxedapplet "plane_point_normal_vector" %}


<p>Note that the plane doesn't care about the length of $\vc{n}$, only
its direction.  In fact, if you change $\vc{n}$ to point in the
opposite direction, you still get the same plane back.  Of course,
changing $P$ to any other point on the plane, wouldn't change the
plane either (though it is difficult to keep $\vc{n}$ the same while changing $P$ in this applet).  </p>

<p>We can infer the equation for the plane from these properties.  Let
$\vc{a}$ be the vector representing the point $P$ (i.e., the vector
from the origin to $P$). Let $\vc{x}=(x,y,z)$ be the vector representing another point $Q$ on the plane.  Since we know $Q$ is in the plane, can you think of any condition on the vector from $P$ to $Q$, i.e., the vector $\vc{x} - \vc{a}$?  In below applet, see if you can infer the relationship between the vector $\vc{x} - \vc{a}$ and the vector $\vc{n}$.</p>

{% boxedapplet "plane_point_normal_vector_additional_point" %}

<p>
If the point represented by $\vc{x}$ is in the plane, the vector $\vc{x}-\vc{a}$ must be parallel to the plane,
hence perpendicular to the normal vector $\vc{n}$.  Two vectors are
perpendicular if their dot product is zero.  We conclude that for any
point represented by $\vc{x}$ that is in the plane, the following
equation must be satisfied:
\begin{align*}
  \vc{n} \cdot (\vc{x}-\vc{a})=0.
\end{align*}
This is the equation for the plane perpendicular to $\vc{n}$ that goes
through the point represented by $\vc{a}$.

{% navigation_tag "plane_three_points" "Three points"%}
<h4>Plane determined by three points</h4>

<p>
We just determined that to write the equation for a plane, we want a
point $P$ in the plane and a normal vector $\vc{n}$.  But
most of us know that three points determine a plane (as long as they
aren't collinear, i.e., lie in straight line).  Here is a plane
determined by three such points.</p>


{% boxedapplet "plane_three_points" %}

<p>
Since a plane is given by a point (say $\color{red}{P}$) and normal
vector, somehow the addition of two points (say, $\color{green}{Q}$ and
$\color{blue}{R}$ must determine the normal vector.  Following the above logic, the normal vector must be perpendicular to the vector from $\color{red}{P}$ to $\color{green}{Q}$ and the vector from $\color{red}{P}$ to $\color{blue}{R}$.
 One way to obtain a
vector perpendicular to two vectors is take their {% intlink "cross_product" %}cross product{%endintlink%}.  The normal vector in the above applet is indeed the cross product of those two vectors.</p>

<p>In summary, if you are given three points, you can take the
cross product of the vectors between two pairs of points to determine
a normal vector $\vc{n}$.  Pick one of the three points, and let
$\vc{a}$ be the vector representing that point.  Then, the same equation described above, 
\begin{align*}
  \vc{n} \cdot (\vc{x}-\vc{a})=0.
\end{align*}
is the equation for the plane going through the three
points.</p>

<p>If you find yourself in a position where you want to find the equation for a plane, look for a way to determine both a normal vector $\vc{n}$ and a point $\vc{a}$ through the plane.  
Then, you can simply use the above equation.  
You can see some {% intlink "forming_plane_examples" %}examples{%endintlink%} for finding the equation of a plane.</p>
