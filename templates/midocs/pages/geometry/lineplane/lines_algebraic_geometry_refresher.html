<p>Let's review some basic <b>analytic geometry:</b> <i>this is description
of geometric objects by numbers and by algebra.</i></p>

<p>The first thing is that we have to pick a <i>special point</i>, the
<b>origin</b>, from which we'll measure everything else. Then,
implicitly, we need to choose a unit of measure for distances, but
this is indeed usually only <i>implicit</i>, so we don't worry about it.</p>

<p>The second step is that <b>points</b> are described by <i>ordered pairs</i> of numbers: the first of the two numbers tells how far
to the <i>right</i> horizontally the point is from the <i>origin</i>
(and <i>negative</i> means go left instead of right), and the second of
the two numbers tells how far <i>up</i> from the origin the point is
(and <i>negative</i> means go down instead of up). The first number is
the <b>horizontal coordinate</b> and the second is the <b>vertical
coordinate</b>. The old-fashioned names <i>abscissa</i> and <i>ordinate</i>
also are used sometimes.</p>

<p>Often the horizontal coordinate is called the <i>x-coordinate</i>, and often the vertical coordinate is called the <i>y-coordinate</i>, but the letters $x,y$ can be used for many other
purposes as well, so <i>don't rely on this labelling!</i></p>

<p>The next idea is that <i>an equation can describe a
curve</i>. It is important to be a little careful with use of language
here: for example, a correct assertion is </p>

<p><i>The set of points $(x,y)$ so that $x^2+y^2=1$ is a
circle</i>.</p>

<p>It is <i>not strictly correct</i> to say that $x^2+y^2=1$ <i>is</i> a circle, mostly because <i>an equation is not a circle</i>, even
though it may <i>describe</i> a circle. And conceivably the $x,y$ might
be being used for something other than horizontal and vertical
coordinates. Still, very often the language is shortened so that the
phrase <i>&lsquo;The set of points $(x,y)$ so that&rsquo;</i> is omitted. Just be
careful.</p>

<p>The simplest curves are <b>lines</b>. The main things to remember are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Slope</b> of a line is <i>rise over run</i>, meaning <i>vertical change divided by horizontal change</i> (moving from left to
right in the usual coordinate system).</li>
<li>The equation of a line passing through a point $(x_o,y_o)$ and
having slope $m$ 
can be written (in so-called <b>point-slope form</b>)
$$y=m(x-x_o)+y_o\;\;\;\;\;\hbox{or}\;\;\;\;\;y-y_o=m(x-x_o)$$</li>
<li>The equation of the line passing through two points $(x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2)$ can be written (in so-called <b>two-point form</b>) as
$$y={y_1-y_2\over x_1-x_2}(x-x_1)+y_1$$</li>
<li> ...unless $x_1=x_2$, in which case the two points are aligned
vertically, and the line can't be written that way. Instead, the
description <b>of a vertical line</b> through a point with horizontal
coordinate $x_1$ is just
$$x=x_1$$</li>
</ul>
 

<p>Of course, the two-point form can be derived from the
point-slope form, since the slope $m$ of a line through two points  
$(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2)$ is that possibly irritating expression which
occurs above:
$$m={y_1-y_2\over x_1-x_2}$$</p>

<p>And now is maybe a good time to point out that there is
nothing sacred about the horizontal coordinate being called &lsquo;$x$&rsquo; and
the vertical coordinate &lsquo;$y$&rsquo;. Very <i>often</i> these <i>do</i> happen
to be the names, but it can be otherwise, so just pay attention.
