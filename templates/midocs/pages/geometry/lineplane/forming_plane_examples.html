<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>Find the equation for the plane through the point $(0,1,-7)$
perpendicular to the vector $(4, -1, 6)$.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b> Let $\vc{a} = (0,1,-7)$.  Let $\vc{n} = (4,-1,6)$.  Then, for
$\vc{x} = (x,y,z)$, the equation for the plane is
\begin{align*}
  \vc{n} \cdot (\vc{x}-\vc{a})=0.
\end{align*}
This becomes
\begin{align*}
  (4,-1,6) \cdot (x-0, y-1, z+7) = 0
\end{align*}
or
\begin{align*}
  4x -(y-1) + 6(z+7) = 0.
\end{align*}
Often, we prefer to write this as
\begin{align*}
  4x -y +6z +43 =0.
\end{align*}
(Note that you can read the normal vector $\vc{n} = (4,-1,6)$ right
from the equation for the plane; the components of $\vc{n}$ are simply
the coefficients of $x$, $y$, and $z$.)

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Find the equation for the plane through the points $(0,1,-7)$,
$(3,1,-9)$, and $(0, -5, -8)$.  </p>

<p><b>Solution:</b> Let $\vc{b} = (0, 1, -7) - (3,1,-9) = (-3, 0, 2)$.  Let
$\vc{c} = (0, 1, -7) - (0 -5, -8) = (0, 6, 1)$.  Then, we can find a
normal vector by taking their {%intlink cross_product %}cross product{%endintlink%}
\begin{align*}
  \vc{n} &amp;= \vc{b} \times \vc{c}\\
  &amp;= 
  \left|
    \begin{array}{rrr}
      \vc{i} &amp; \vc{j} &amp; \vc{k}\\
      -3 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\
      0 &amp; 6 &amp; 1
    \end{array}
  \right|
  \\
  &amp;= \vc{i} (0 -12) - \vc{j} (-3 -0) + \vc{k}(-18 -0)\\
  &amp;= (-12, 3, -18).
\end{align*}
We'll pick the first point and let $\vc{a} = (0, 1, -7)$.  The
equation for the plane becomes
\begin{align*}
  (-12, 3, -18) \cdot (x-0, y-1, z+7) = 0
\end{align*}
which we rewrite as
\begin{align*}
  -12x +3(y-1) -18(z+7) = 0
\end{align*}
or
\begin{align*}
  -12x +3y -18z - 129 = 0.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>The planes from both examples went through the
same point $(0, 1, -7)$.  Did you also notice that their normal
vectors are parallel to each other?  If you multiply the $\vc{n}$ from
Example 1 by $-3$, you obtain the $\vc{n}$ from Example 2:
\begin{align*}
  -3(4, -1, 6) = (-12, 3, -18).
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>What does that mean about the relationship between the two planes?
The two planes must be equal.
(See the {%intlink forming_planes%}page on forming planes{%endintlink%} for a discussion of this fact.)
In fact, if you divide both sides of the equation of the second plane
by $-3$, you get the equation of the first plane.

<h4>Example 3</h4>

<p>Find the equation for the plane through the points $(1,2,3)$,
$(2,4,6)$, and $(-3,-6,-9)$.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b> Let $\vc{b} = (2,4,6) - (1,2,3) = (1,2,3)$ and let $\vc{c} =
(1,2,3) - (-3,-6,-9) = (4, 8, 12)$.  Then, we attempt to find a normal
vector as their cross product:
\begin{align*}
  \vc{n} &amp;= \vc{b} \times \vc{c}\\
  &amp;= 
  \left|
    \begin{array}{rrr}
      \vc{i} &amp; \vc{j} &amp; \vc{k}\\
      1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\
      4 &amp; 8 &amp; 12
    \end{array}
  \right|
  \\
  &amp;= \vc{i} (24 -24) - \vc{j} (12 -12) + \vc{k}(8 -8)\\
  &amp;= (0, 0, 0).
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
Something clearly went wrong, as we weren't able to find a normal
direction.  Do the three points actually determine a plane?  If you
are still puzzled, check the page on {%intlink forming_planes plane_three_points %}forming planes{%endintlink%} for any conditions on the ability of three points to determine a plane.
