{% title "Parametrization of a line" %}
{% description "Introduction to how one can parametrize a line. Interactive graphics illustrate basic concepts." %}

<p>A line is determined by two points $\color{red} P$ and
$\color{green} Q$. The following applet illustrates this simple idea.
You can change the position of the line by moving the red or the green
point with the mouse.  Dragging with the mouse elsewhere rotates the
picture.</p>

{% boxedapplet "line_two_points" %}
  
<p>We want to write an equation for the line.  However, since we are
in three dimensions, we can't write a single equation like $y=2x-3$ to
describe the line.  (If you don't believe this statement, check out
{%intlink line_plane_point %}this page{%endintlink%}.)  Instead, we'll write a
<i>parametrization</i> for the line.</p>

<p>Before we continue, let's to change our perspective about the line.
First, rather than thinking of a line being determined by two points,
we'll think of it as being determined by a point $\color{red} P$ and
a vector  $\color{green}{\vc{v}}$  <b>parallel</b> to the line.  (The
vector $\color{green}{\vc{v}}$ could simply be the vector from the
point $\color{red} P$ to the point $\color{green} Q$.) </p>

<p>Second, we'll think of the point $\color{red} P$ as the endpoint of
a vector $\color{red}{\vc{a}}$ with tail at the origin.  We could
visualize the new perspective with the following applet.  It's
essentially identical to the above applet, except that I've drawn in
the vectors mentioned above.  You can drag the tips of the vectors to change the line.
 </p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the  arrowheads of vectors don't always stay visible.
We obtain a most consistent view by drawing vectors with dots for arrowheads. </p>

{% boxedapplet "line_two_vectors" %}

<p>Now we are ready to derive a condition for a point
$\color{blue}{\vc{x}}$ being on the line determined by
$\color{red}{\vc{a}}$ and $\color{green}{\vc{v}}$.  We represent a
point $\color{blue}{\vc{x}}$ on the line by the vector
$\color{blue}{\vc{x}}$ pictured in blue in the below applet. (We will
refer to the point $\color{blue}{\vc{x}}$ as being the endpoint of the
vector $\color{blue}{\vc{x}}$ when its tail is fixed at the origin.)
By the definition of our line, the point $\color{blue}{\vc{x}}$ is on
the line if the vector from $\color{red}{\vc{a}}$ to
$\color{blue}{\vc{x}}$ (i.e, $\color{cyan}{\vc{x}-\vc{a}}$, pictured
in cyan below) is parallel to $\color{green}{\vc{v}}$ (in green).</p>


{% boxedapplet "point_on_line_two_vectors" %}


<p> What does it mean for two vectors to be parallel?  (Note that we
use the term &ldquo;parallel&rdquo; to include what you might think of
as anti-parallel, meaning pointing in opposite directions.)  Two
vectors are parallel if one vector can be expressed as a
<i>scalar multiple</i> of the other.  So, $\color{cyan}{\vc{x}-\vc{a}}$ is
parallel to $\color{green}{\vc{v}}$ if and only if $\color{cyan}{\vc{x}-\vc{a}} = t \color{green}{\vc{v}}$ for
some $t \in \vc{R}$.  We usually write this condition for $\vc{x}$
being on the line as $$\vc{x} = t \vc{v} +
\vc{a}.$$
This equation is called the parametrization of the line, where $t$ is a
free parameter that is allowed to be any real number.
</p>

<p>The idea of the parametrization is that as the parameter $t$ sweeps
through all real numbers, $\vc{x}$ sweeps out the line.  In the last
applet on this page, we've changed the perspective so that now you
control $t$ by moving the point on the slider.  To make visualization
a little easier, we show only the endpoints of the vectors $\vc{a}$
and $\vc{x}$. </p>
