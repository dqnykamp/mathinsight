<p>Find intersection of planes given by 
$x+y+z+1=0$ and $x + 2y + 3z +4=0$.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>:  In three dimensions (which we are implicitly working
with here), what is the intersection of two planes?  As long as the
planes are not parallel, they should intersect in a line.  So our
result should be a line.</p>

<p>How does one write an equation for a line in three dimensions?  You
should convince yourself that a {% intlink "line_plane_point" %}graph of
a single equation cannot be a line{%endintlink%} in three dimensions.
Instead, to describe a line, you need to find a 
{% intlink "line_parametrization" %}parametrization of the line{%endintlink%}.
</p>

<p>How can we obtain a parametrization for the line formed by the
intersection of these two planes?  We need an equation for all
$(x,y,z)$ that satisfy both $x+y+z+1=0$ and $x + 2y + 3z +4=0$.  
We start be attemping to solve this system of two equations.  
Since this is a system of two equations and three unknowns, 
we know we can't solve it for a unique $(x,y,z)$.  
But this is consistent with our above conclusion that the intersection is a line, not a point.   
We want a whole bunch of $(x,y,z)$ that satisfy the two equations.
</p>

<p>We could use either the method of &ldquo;substitution&rdquo; or the method of
&ldquo;elimination&rdquo; to solve these equations.  We'll use the method of
elimination.  Since in both equations, $x$ has a coefficient of 1,
we'll subtract the two equations to eliminate $x$.  If we subtract
$x+y+z+1=0$ from $x + 2y + 3z +4=0$, we are left with
\begin{align*}
  y+2z+3=0
\end{align*}
which we can rewrite as $y=-2z-3$.</p>


<p>We don't have enough equations to uniquely solve for either $y$ or $z$.
We'll simply set $z=t$, where $t$ can be any real number.
The variable $t$ will be our free parameter for the parametrization of the line.
Since we found that $y=2z-3$, we can write it in terms of $t$ as $y=-2t-3$. 
To find $x$ in terms of $t$, we plug these values of $y$ and $z$ into
one of the original equations.  We'll use the first one so that
\begin{align*}
  x=-y-z-1=2t+3-t-1=t+2.
\end{align*}
We can write our parametrization of the line as 
\begin{align*}
  (x,y,z) = (t+2, -2t-3, t).
\end{align*}
