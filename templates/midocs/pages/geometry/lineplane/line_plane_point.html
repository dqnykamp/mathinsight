<h4>Example 1: $y=3x-2$</h4>

<p>Is the graph of $y=3x-2$ the graph of a line or a plane or a point?
You might recognize this as a familiar form of the equation of a line
with slope 3 and $y$-intercept $-2$, as in the following graph.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image line_in_2D %}</p>

<p>However, if we think $y=3x-2$ is a line, we have implicitly assumed
that the equation $y=3x-2$ is an equation in two dimensions, i.e., in
the two variables $x$ and $y$.  It could actually be an equation in
three dimensions, say with the variables $x$, $y$, and $z$.  Although
the $z$ doesn't appear in the equation, we could think of the equation
as having a $z$ with a coefficient of zero.  We could write the
equation as $y=3x+0z-2$.  Here's what plotting the equation $y=3x-2$
in a three-dimensional coordinate system looks like.</p>

<p>Before rotating, the graph looks like the previous one, as the $z$
dimension is hidden.  The fact that the graph is a plane doesn't become
obvious until you rotate the axis.</p>

<p>We conclude that we don't know what the graph of $y=3x-2$ is unless we
specify the number of dimensions.  If we want to specify a line, one
way is to use a {%intlink line_parametrization %}parametrization of a line{%endintlink%}.  The parametrization of a line has
the advantage that it gives you a line no matter how many dimensions
you are working in.</p>

<h4>Example 2: $x=3$</h4>

<p>Is the graph of $x=3$ the graph of a line or a plane or a point?  Just
like above, the answer will depend on the dimensions we are working
in.  In one dimension, $x=3$ is just a point, as in a point on the
number line.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image point_in_1D %}</p>


<p>In two dimensions, the graph is a line, as you can see by rotating the
below graph.</p>

<p>And, in three dimensions, the graph of $x=3$ is a plane.</p>
