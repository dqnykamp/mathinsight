{% description "An example of calculating the distance from a point to a plane." %}

<p>To illustrate our approach for {% intlink distance_point_plane %}finding the distance between a point and a plane{%endintlink%}, we work through an example.</p>

<p>Find the distance from the point $P=(4,-4,3)$ to the plane
$2x-2y+5z+8=0$, which is pictured in the below figure in its original
view (which you can restore by pressing Home).</p>

{% boxedapplet "distance_point_plane" %}

<p><b>Solution:</b> We use the {%intlink distance_point_plane distance_formula_2 %}second formula{%endintlink%} from the {%intlink distance_point_plane %}page on distance from a point to a plane{%endintlink%}. 
From the equation for the plane
we substitute $A=2$, $B=-2$, $C=5$, $D=8$.  From the point $P$, we
substitute $x_1=4$, $y_1=-4$, and $z_1=3$.  The distance from $P$ to
the plane is
\begin{align*}
  d = \frac{|2 \cdot 4 + (-2)\cdot(-4) + 5 \cdot 3 + 8 |}
  {\sqrt{2^2+(-2)^2 + 5^2}}
  = \frac{39}{\sqrt{33}} \approx 6.8
\end{align*}
