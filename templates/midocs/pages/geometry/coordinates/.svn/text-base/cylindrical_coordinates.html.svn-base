{% description "Illustration of cylindrical coordinates with interactive graphics." %}

<p>Cylindrical coordinates are a simple extension of the two-dimensional {% intlink polar_coordinates%}polar coordinates{%endintlink%} to three dimensions.  Recall that the position of a point in the plane can be described using polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$.  The polar coordinate $r$ is the distance of the point from the origin.  The polar coordinate $\theta$ is the angle between the $x$-axis and the line segment from the origin to the point.  Polar coordinates are illustrated in the below figure and described more in {% intlink polar_coordinates%}another page{%endintlink%}.</p>

<p>Cylindrical coordinates simply combine the polar coordinates in the $xy$-plane with the usual $z$ coordinate of {%intlink cartesian_coordinates 3dspace%}Cartesian coordinates{%endintlink%}.  To form the cylindrical coordinates of a point $P$, simply project it down to a point $Q$ in the $xy$-plane (see the below figure).  Then, take the polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$ of the point $Q$, i.e., $r$ is the distance from the origin to $Q$ and $\theta$ is the angle between the positive $x$-axis and the line segment from the origin to $Q$.  The third cylindrical coordinate is the same as the usual $z$-coordinate.  It is the signed distance of the point $P$ to the $xy$-plane (being negative is $P$ is below the $xy$-plane).  The below figure illustrates the cylindrical coordinates $(r,\theta,z)$ of the point $P$.</p>

<p>You can further explore the properties of the cylindrical coordinates with the follow applet.  You can observe how changing the coordinates $(r,\theta,z)$ changes the position of the point $P$.  Just as with polar coordinates, we usually limit $0 \le \theta < 2\pi$ and $r \ge 0$ to descrease the non-uniqueness of cylindrical coordinates.  However, when $r=0$, there is a non-uniqueness since the point $P$ is on the $z$ axis when $r=0$, independent of the value of $\theta$.</p>
