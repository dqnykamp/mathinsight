{% title "Spherical coordinates" %}
{% description "Illustration of spherical coordinates with interactive graphics." %}

<p>Spherical coordinates can be a little challenging to understand at first.  Spherical coordinates determine the position of a point in three-dimensional space based on the distance $\rho$ from the origin and two angles $\theta$ and $\phi$.  If one is familiar with {% intlink "polar_coordinates" %}polar coordinates{%endintlink%}, then the angle $\theta$ isn't too difficult to understand as it is essentially the same as the angle $\theta$ from polar coordinates.   But some people have trouble grasping what the
angle $\phi$ is all about.</p>

<p>The following graphics and interactive applets may help you understand spherical
coordinates better.  On this page, we <a href="#relationship_cartesian">derive the relationship</a> between spherical and Cartesian coordinates, show an <a href="#explore_influence">applet that allows you to explore</a> the influence of each spherical coordinate, and illustrate <a href="#sphere_surf">simple spherical coordinate surfaces</a>. </p>

<h4>Relationship between spherical and Cartesian coordinates</h4>

<p>Spherical coordinates are defined as indicated in the
following figure, which illustrates the spherical coordinates of the
point $P$.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "spherical_coordinates" %}</p>

<p>The coordinate $\rho$ is the distance from $P$ to the origin.  If the
point $Q$ is the projection of $P$ to the $xy$-plane, then $\theta$ is
the angle between the positive $x$-axis and the line segment from the origin
to $Q$.  Lastly, $\phi$ is the angle between the positive $z$-axis and
the line segment from the origin to $P$.</p>


<p class="centeredImage">{% image "spherical_coordinates_cartesian" %}</p>

<p>We can calculate the relationship between the Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$ of the point $P$ and its spherical coordinates $(\rho,\theta,\phi)$ using trigometry. The gray triangle above is the right triangle whose vertices are the origin, the point $P$, and its projection onto the $z$-axis. As the length of the hypotenuse is $\rho$ and $\phi$ is the angle the hypothenuse makes with the $z$-axis leg of the right triangle, the $z$-coordinate of $P$ (i.e., the height of the triangle) is $z=\rho\cos\phi$.  The length of the  other leg of the right triangle is the distance from $P$ to the $z$-axis, which is $r=\rho\sin\phi$.  The distance of the point $Q$ from the origin is the same quantity.</p>

<p>The cyan triangle, shown in both the original 3D coordinate system on the left and in the $xy$-plane on the right, is the right triangle whose vertices are the origin, the point $Q$, and its projection onto the $x$-axis.  In the right plot, the distance from $Q$ to the origin, which is the length of hypotenuse of the right triangle, is labeled just as $r$.  As $\theta$ is the angle this hypotenuse makes with the $x$-axis, the $x$- and $y$-components of the point $Q$ (which are the same as the $x$- and $y$-components of the point $P$) are given by $x=r\cos\theta$ and $y=r\sin\theta$.  Since $r=\rho\sin\phi$, these components can be rewritten as $x=\rho\sin\phi\cos\theta$ and $y=\rho\sin\phi\sin\theta$.  In summary, the formulas for Cartesian coordinates in terms of spherical coordinates are
\begin{align}
  x &amp;= \rho\sin\phi\cos\theta\notag\\
  y &amp;= \rho\sin\phi\sin\theta{% equation_tag "spherical_cartesian" 1 %}\\
  z &amp;= \rho\cos\phi\notag.
\end{align}

{% navigation_tag "explore_influence" "Explore influence" %}
<h4>Exploring the influence of each spherical coordinate</h4>


<p>The below applet allows you to see how the location of a point changes as
you vary $\rho$, $\theta$, and $\phi$.  The point $P$ corresponding to the value of the coordinates is shown as a large purple point.  
The green dot is the point $Q$, i.e., the projection of $P$ in the $xy$-plane.</p>


{% boxedapplet "spherical_coordinates" %}

<p>Notice how you can obtain any point even though we restrict $\rho \ge
0$, $0 \le \theta < 2\pi$, and $0 \le \phi \le \pi$.  Can you see why
we only need $\phi$ to go up to $\pi$?  </p>

<p>These restrictions removed much of the non-uniqueness of spherical
coordinates.  Notice there is still non-uniqueness at $\rho =0$, at
$\phi = 0$ and at $\phi=\pi$.  When any of these conditions are true,
you can change the value of one or more of the other coordinates
without moving the point.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the convention for the notation of spherical coordinates is not standardized across disciplines.  For example, in physics, the roles of $\theta$ and $\phi$ are typically reversed.  In order to correctly understand someone's use of spherical coordinates, you must first determine what notational convention this are using.  You cannot assume they follow the convention used here.</p>



{% navigation_tag "sphere_surf" "Surfaces" %}
<h4>Simple spherical coordinate surfaces</h4>


<p>These three next applets may help you understand what each of three
spherical coordinates means.  They show what the surfaces $\phi=$
constant, $\theta=$ constant, and $\rho=$ constant look like.  The
value of the constant is determined by the position of the sliders.
In all cases, we restrict the surfaces to the region $\rho <5$.</p>

{% navigation_tag "const_phi" "Surfaces" "Constant $\phi$" %}
<h5>Constant $\phi$</h5>

<p>What does it mean for a point to have the spherical coordinate $\phi=\pi/3$?  Take a look at the surfaces that are
defined by the equation $\phi=$ constant.</p>

{% boxedapplet "spherical_coordinates_constant_phi" %}

<p>The surface $\phi=$ constant is simply a single cone, pointing either
upward or downward.  If you know that $\phi=\pi/3$, then you know the
point is somewhere on a (wide) single cone that opens upward, i.e., the
equation $\phi=\pi/3$ specifies a surface that is a single cone opening
upward.  The equation $\phi=\pi/2$ corresponds to the $xy$-plane.</p>

<p>The surface $\phi=$ constant is rotationally symmetric around the $z$-axis.  Therefore it must depend on $x$ and $y$ only via the distance $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ from the $z$-axis.  Using the relationship \eqref{spherical_cartesian} between spherical and Cartesian coordinates, one can calculate that 
\begin{align*}
x^2+y^2 &amp;= \rho^2\sin^2\phi(\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta)\\
  &amp;= \rho^2\sin^2\phi
\end{align*}
or $\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = \rho\sin\phi$.  (Given that $0 \le \phi \le \pi$, we know that $\sin \phi \ge 0$ and the positive square root is $\rho\sin\phi$.)  If we divide by $z=\rho\cos\phi$, we obtain a formula for $\phi$ in terms of Cartesian coordinates 
$$\frac{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}{z} = \tan \phi.$$
We can rewrite the surface $\phi=$ constant as
$$z = C \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$$
where $C=1/\tan \phi$, which is indeed the equation for a cone.</p>

{% navigation_tag "const_theta" "Surfaces" "Constant $\theta$" %}
<h5>Constant $\theta$</h5>

<p>The surface $\theta=$ constant is a half-plane off the $z$-axis.  (It
is plotted as a half-disk only because we restrict the plot to
$\rho<5$.)</p>

{% boxedapplet "spherical_coordinates_constant_theta" %}



<p>If a point has $\theta=\pi/2$, then you know the point is on the
half of the $yz$-plane where $y$ values are positive.  The equation
$\theta=\pi/2$ is the equation for this half-plane.</p>

<p>From relationship \eqref{spherical_cartesian}, the ratio between $x$ and $y$ can be written, for example, as $y/x = \tan \theta$.  If $\theta$ is held constant, then the ratio between $x$ and $y$ is constant.  Thus, the equation $\theta=$ constant gives a line through the origin in the $xy$-plane.  Since $z$ is unrestricted, we get a vertical plane.  Looking back at relationship \eqref{spherical_cartesian}, we see it is only a half plane because $\rho\sin\phi$ cannot be negative.</p>



{% navigation_tag "const_rho" "Surfaces" "Constant $\rho$" %}
<h5>Constant $\rho$</h5>

<p>Most people don't have trouble understanding what $\rho=3$ means.  It is the
sphere of radius 3 centered at the origin.  In general, the surface
$\rho=$ constant is a sphere of radius $\rho$ centered at the origin.</p>

{% boxedapplet "spherical_coordinates_constant_rho" %}
 
<p>
From relationship \eqref{spherical_cartesian}, we can calculate that
\begin{align*}
  x^2+y^2+z^2 &amp;= \rho^2\sin^2\phi(\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta) + \rho^2\cos^2\phi\\
  &amp;= \rho^2(\sin^2\phi+\cos^2\phi)\\
  &amp;= \rho^2
\end{align*}
verifying that $\rho=$ constant is the sphere of radius $\rho$ centered at the origin.
