{% description "Examples of forming an inverse function that does undoes the action of another function." %}

<p>An {% intlink inverse_function_definition %}inverse function{%endintlink%} is a function that undoes the action of the another function.  Using {% intlink function_machine %}function machine{%endintlink%} metaphor, forming an inverse function means {% intlink function_machine_inverse %}running the function machine backwards{%endintlink%}.  The backwards function machine will work only if the original function machine produces a unique output for each unique input.</p>

<p>In the following examples, we demonstrate a few simple cases where one can calculate the inverse function.  In most cases, though, we cannot write down a nice formula for the inverse function.</p>

{% navigation_tag "example1" "Examples" "Example 1" %}
<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>Let $f: \R \to \R$ {% confusedlink function_notation %} be defined by $f(x)=3x+1$.  Find the inverse function $f^{-1}$.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: For any input $x$, the function machine corresponding to $f$ spits out the value $y=f(x)=3x+1$.  We want to find the function $f^{-1}$ that takes the value $y$ as an input and spits out $x$ as the output.  In other words, $y=f(x)$ gives $y$ as a function of $x$, and we want to find $x=f^{-1}(y)$ that will give us $x$ as a function of $y$.</p>

<p>To calculate $x$ as a function of $y$, we just take the expression $y=3x+1$ for $y$ as a function of $x$ and solve for $x$.
\begin{align*}
  y &= 3x+1\\
  y-1 &= 3x\\
  \frac{y-1}{3} &= x
\end{align*}
Therefore, we found out that $x=y/3 - 1/3$, so we can write the inverse function as 
$$f^{-1}(y) = \frac{y}{3} - \frac{1}{3}.$$
</p>

<p>In the definition of the function $f^{-1}$, there's nothing special about using the variable $y$.  We could use any other variable, and write the answer as $f^{-1}(x) = x/3-1/3$ or $f^{-1}(\bigstar) = \bigstar/3 -1/3$.  The placeholder variable used in the formula for a function doesn't matter.</p>

<p>To verify that $f^{-1}$ is really the inverse of $f$, we should show that the {% intlink composition_definition%}composition{%endintlink%} of $f$ and $f^{-1}$ doesn't do anything to the input.  In this case, the order shouldn't matter, and the functions $f \circ f^{-1}$ and $f^{-1} \circ $f$ should both do nothing.  Let's check this.</p>

<p>First, we apply $f$ followed by $f^{-1}$.
\begin{align*}
(f^{-1} \circ f)(x) &= f^{-1}(f(x))\\
&=f^{-1}(3x+1)\\
&=(3x+1)/3 - 1/3\\
&= x +1/3 -1/3 = x
\end{align*}
Second, we apply $f^{-1}$ followed by $f$.
\begin{align*}
(f \circ f^{-1})(x) &= f(f^{-1}(x))\\
&= f(x/3-1/3)\\
&= 3(x/3-1/3) +1\\
&= x - 1 + 1 = x
\end{align*}
In both cases, applying both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ to $x$ gave us back $x$.  Indeed, $f^{-1}(x) = x/3-1/3$.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Let $f: \R \to \R$ be defined by $f(x)=x^2$.  Does this function posses an inverse function?</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: For any real number $x$, both $f(x)$ and $f(-x)$ yield the same number, namely $f(x)=f(-x) = x^2$.  If $x \ne 0$, then $x$ and $-x$ are different numbers, and $f$ maps these two distinct numbers to the same output number.  For example, given that the output of $f(x)$ was $y=4$, there's no way to know if $x=2$ or $x=-2$ was the input to the function.  There's no way to run the function machine backwards, and $f$ does not posses an inverse function.</p>


{% navigation_tag "example2p" "Examples" "Example 2'" %}
<h4>Example 2'</h4>

<p>Let $f: \R_{\ge 0} \to \R$ be defined by $f(x)=x^2$, where the domain $\R_{\ge 0}$ is the set of non-negative real numbers. Does this function posses an inverse function?  If so, find $f^{-1}$.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: In this case, since we restrict the domain to the non-negative real numbers, every distinct input value $x \ge 0$ will yield a distinct output value $x^2$.  For this function $f$, we can find its inverse.</p>

<p>Set $y=f(x)=x^2$.  To solve for $x$ in terms of $y$, we just take the square root of both sides, and $x = \sqrt{y}$.  The inverse function is $f^{-1}(y) = \sqrt{y}$.</p>

{% navigation_tag "example3" "Examples" "Example 3" %}
<h4>Example 3</h4>

<p>Let $f: \R \to \R$ be defined by $f(x)=1+2x+3x^3+4x^5+5x^7+6x^9$.  Find $f^{-1}$.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>:  The function $f$ always increases as you increase the value of its input $x$, so no two values of $x$ can yield the same output value $f(x)$.  The function does indeed have an inverse function; we can run its function machine backward with no problem.</p>

<p>However, we are out of luck when it comes to finding a formula for $f^{-1}$.  Although we know that, given a particular value of $y$, there must be exactly one real value of $x$ that satisfies $y=1+2x+3x^3+4x^5+5x^7+6x^9$, we cannot analytically solve that equation for $x$ in terms of $y$.</p>

<p>The fact that we cannot find a formula for $f^{-1}(y)$ doesn't make the function any less valid than the other inverse functions.  It is a perfectly well behaved function.  We just don't have a nice way to write down what the function looks like in terms of familar looking expressions.</p>
