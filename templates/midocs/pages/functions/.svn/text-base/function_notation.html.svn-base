<p>Recall the notation that $\R$ stands for the
real numbers.  Similarly, $\R^2$ is a
two-dimensional vector, and $\R^3$ is a three-dimensional
vector.</p>

<h4>Scalar-valued functions</h4>

<p>In one-variable calculus, you worked a lot with one-variable
functions, i.e., functions from $\R$ onto $\R$.  If
$f(x)$ is such a one-variable functions, we can write $f: \R
\to \R$ as a shorthand way of expressing that $f$ is a
function from $\R$ onto $\R$.</p>

<p>A function like $f(x,y) = x+y$ is a function of two variables.  It
takes an element of $\R^2$, like $(2,1)$, and gives a value that is a
real number (i.e., an element of $\R$), like $f(2,1)= 3$.  Since $f$
maps $\R^2$ to $\R$, we write $f : \R^2 \to \R$.  We can also use this
&ldquo;mapping&rdquo; notation to define the actual function.  We could define the
above $f(x,y)$ by writing $f: (x,y) \mapsto x+y$. </p>

<p>To contrast a simple real number with a vector, we refer to the real
number as a <i>scalar</i>.  Hence, we can refer to $f : \R^2 \to \R$
as a scalar-valued function of two variables or even just say it is a
real-valued function of two variables.</p>

<p>Everything works the same for scalar valued functions of three or more
variables.  For example, $f(x,y,z)$, which we can write $f : \R^3 \to
\R$, is a scalar-valued function of three variables.</p>

<h4>Vector-valued functions</h4>

<p>In contrast, a <i>vector-valued function</i> takes on values that
are vectors.  First, let's talk about vector-valued functions of a
single variable.</p>

<p>A vector-valued function in two dimensions can be written $f :
\R \to \R^2$.  An example is $\vc{f}(t)=(3t,-t)$.  For
a given real number, which we'll denote by $\clubsuit$ for fun,
$\vc{f}(\clubsuit)$ is the two-dimensional vector
$(3\clubsuit,-\clubsuit)$.  Similarly, a vector-valued function in
three dimensions can be written $f : \R \to \R^3$.
For example, if $\vc{f}(s) =(1-s,s^3, \cos s)$, then $\vc{f}(0) =
(1,0,1)$.  We sometimes write vector-valued functions using the
standard unit vector $\vc{i}$, $\vc{j}$, and $\vc{k}$, as in
$\vc{f}(s) = (1-s)\vc{i} + s^3 \vc{j} + (\cos s) \vc{k}$.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, we can have vector-valued functions of multiple variables.
For example, a function could take values in $\R^3$, say $(x,y,z)$,
and map them to $\R^2$, such as $f(x,y,z) = (x-y, x^{22}/z)$.  We can
write a function from $\R^3$ to $\R^2$ as $f: \R^3 \to \R^2$.  You get
the idea.</p>



<h4>The domain of a function</h4>


<p>
The function $f(t) = (t, t^2)$ is defined over all real numbers $\R$,
i.e., the <i>domain</i> of the function is $\R$.  Sometimes a
function of one variable may be defined over a subset of real numbers,
say some set $U \subset \R$; in this case, the domain of the function is
$U$.  (Note, the symbol &ldquo;$\subset$&rdquo; just means &ldquo;is subset of&rdquo;.)  In three dimensions, for example, we can specify the domain by
writing $\vc{f} : U \subset \R \to \R^3$, or simply $\vc{f} :U \to
\vc{R}^3$. </p>

<p>Example: since $\log t$ isn't a real number for $t \le 0$, the domain
of $\vc{f}(t) = (\log t) \vc{i} + t \vc{j}$, is the set $D=(0,
\infty)$.  We could write this $\vc{f} : (0,\infty) \to
\R^2$.  What would the domain be if we replaced $\log t$ with
$\log (t-3)$ or $\log (2-t)$?  You have to think where $\log (t-3)$ or
$\log (2-t)$ is a real number, i.e., where $t-3>0$ or where $2-t>0$.
</p>

<p>
We use the same notation for functions of multiple variables.  If we
wrote $\vc{f}: U \subset \R^2 \to \R^3$, we would mean a function maps
values in a subset $U$ of $\R^2$ to values in $\R^3$.</p>
