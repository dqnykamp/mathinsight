{% description "Illustrating function parameters as dials that influence the behavior of a function machine." %}

<p>The {% intlink function_machine %}function machine{%endintlink%} is a handy metaphor that illustrates how {% intlink function_definition%}functions{%endintlink%} work.  A function $f$ takes an input, say represented by the {% intlink variable_definition%}variable{%endintlink%} $x$, and spits out the value $f(x)$.</p>

<p>The function machine metaphor can also aid one in understanding how a function can depend on {% intlink parameter_definition%}parameters{%endintlink%}.  Parmameters are additional quantities that influence the behavior of the function.  However, unlike the input variables, parameters are typically viewed as being held constant, or possibly changing slowly.</p>

<p>The influence of parameters on a function is the like influence of dials on a machine.  For a given setting of the dials, the machine processes the inputs in a certain way.  If one leaves the dials fixed, then the function machine always spits out the same output value for a given fixed input value.</p>

<p>If one wishes to change how the machine is operating, one can adjust one of the dials, i.e., change one of the parameters.  When the dials are changed, the machine still process the inputs and turns them into outputs.  However, with new parameters, for the same fixed input value, the function machine may now spit out a different output value than it did before the parameters were changed.</p>

<p>For example, we could define a quadratic function $f$ with three parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$ as
\begin{align*}
f(x) = ax^2 + bx +c.
\end{align*}
For a given set of parameters, such as $a=b=c=1$, the function $f$ behaves like a normal function.  Since with these parameters, $f(x)=x^2+x+1$, whenever we put $x=2$ in the function machine, it always produces $f(2) = 2^2+2+1=7$.</p>

<p>When we change the parameters, we turn $f$ into a different function.  For example, if we change $a$ into $a=2$, now $f$ operates using the formula $f(x) = 2x^2+x+1$, and $f(2)=2\cdot 2^2+2+1 =11$.  In this sense, a function with parameters represents a whole family of functions, one for each value of the parameters.</p>

<p>If we don't know specific values for the parameter, we can still use the function machine to operate on input values.  If we leave the parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$ as their symbols, then $f(2)= 4a+2b+c$.  Then, once we know numerical values for the parameters, we can immediately determine a numeric value for $f(2)$.</p>

  <h4>Parameters, input variables: what's the difference?</h4>

  <p>For the function $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$, could we learn something by leaving the expression in terms of the symbols $a$, $b$, and $c$ and seeing how $f(x)$ depends on the parameters?  Maybe we could fix $x=2$ and look how $f(2)$ changes as we let $a$ vary.</p>

<p>If we do such manipulations and look at how the output of a function depends on varying a parameter, then we are treating the function as though the parameter were a input variable.  But that's OK, as the difference between variables and parameters is really just a matter of perspective.</p>

<p>The output of the function machine will depend both on the setting of the dial and the object we put in the input funnel.  The behavior of the function machine would not change if we replaced one of the dials with another input funnel and specified the former dial's setting by putting an object representing that setting into the new input funnel.  In this sense, inputs and parameters are equivalent.</p>

<p>The distinction between inputs and parameters is merely a matter of convenience.  If we know that a setting is going to stay fixed for awhile, it is more convenient to represent it with a dial that doesn't change its value until we manually change it.  Then, it is natural to explore the behavior of the function machine with many inputs before changing a parameter value.</p>
