{% description "List of topics that could be on the applications of differentiaion module exam." %}


<p>The applications of differentiation module exam for Math 1241 is based on part 4 from the <a href="{% url 'mithreads-thread' 'math1241' %}">Math 1241 thread</a>.  The following highlights what is and what is not good potential material for this exam.</p>



<ol><li>
<p>Stability of equilibria in discrete dynamical systems (<a href="{% url 'mithreads-thread' 'math1241' %}#stability_equilibria_discrete_dynamical_systems">Stability of equilibria from Math 1241 thread</a>).</p>

<ol>
<li>To calculate the stability of an equilibrium, put the system in
  function iteration form: $x_{t+1}=f(x_{t})$.  Then, an equilibrium
  $x_n =E$ is stable if $|f'(E)| < 1$ and is unstable if $|f'(E)| >1$.</li>
<li>Be able to calculate equilibria and stability of dynamical systems
  that include parameters.  This is where the derivative method for
  stability shines, as we cannot determine stability graphically if we
  don't have numbers for all the parameters.  Be able able to
  determine the values of a parameter that make an equilibrium stable.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>Logistic growth (<a href="{% url 'mithreads-thread' 'math1241' %}#logistic_growth">Logistic growth from Math 1241 thread</a>).</p>

<ol>
<li>The discrete logistic equation captures how growth slows down when a population begins to exhaust its environment.</li>
<li>It is primarily an example that we can use for determining equilibria and stability.</li>
<li>We're primarily concerned with the case where the upper positive equilibrium is stable.  In this case, the upper equilibrium is the carry capacity, and small population sizes will grow to this carrying capacity.
<li>If both equilibria are unstable, the discrete logistic equation can have complicated behavior, but we won't cover this on the exam.
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>Minimization and maximization (<a href="{% url 'mithreads-thread' 'math1241' %}#minimization_maximization">Minimization and maximization from Math 1241 thread</a>).</p>

<ol>
<li>Be able to identify local and global minima and maxima by checking the
  critical points and the endpoints.</li>

<li>Be able to identify local minima and maxima by checking the second
  derivative at critical points or the sign of the second derivative on either side of the critical points.</li>

<li>The problem of maximimizing the harvest of natural populations combines the discrete dynamical system equilibria with maximimization.</li>

</ol>
</li>

<li><p>Taylor polynomials (<a href="{% url 'mithreads-thread' 'math1241' %}#taylor_polynomials">Taylor polynomials from Math 1241 thread</a>).</p>

<ol>
<li>Be able to compute linear and quadratic approximations of a
  function around a point.</li>

<li>The linear approximation should match the function and its
  derivative at the point (i.e., be a tangent line approximation).</li>

<li>The quadratic approximation should match the function, its first
  derivative, and its second derivative at the point.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
