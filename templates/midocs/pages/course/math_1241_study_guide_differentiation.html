{% description "List of topics that could be on the differentation module exam." %}

<p>The differentiation module exam for Math 1241 is based on part 3 from the <a href="{% url 'mithreads-thread' 'math1241' %}">Math 1241 thread</a>, with the knowledge from part 1 also assumed.  The following highlights what is and what is not good potential material for this exam.</p>


<ol><li>
<p>Preliminary exploration of the derivative (<a href="{% url 'mithreads-thread' 'math1241' %}#preliminary_exploration">See section from the Math 1241 thread</a>)</p>

<p>You should understand how the linear approximation used to determine stability of an equilibrium is the tangent line of the function, whose slope is the derivative.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Introduction to the derivative (<a href="{% url 'mithreads-thread' 'math1241' %}#derivative_introduction">See section from the Math 1241 thread</a>)</p>


<ol>
<li>The slope of the secant line as average rate of the change, and the
  slope of the tangent line as instantaneous rate of change.</li>
<li>The tangent line as the limit of a secant line with the two points approaching each other.</li>
<li>The derivative is the slope of the tangent line, which we also call the slope of the function itself.</li>
<li>The limit as the idea of getting as close as possible with actually going all the way.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><p>Derivatives of polynomials (<a href="{% url 'mithreads-thread' 'math1241' %}#derivatives_polynomials">See section from the Math 1241 thread</a>)</p>


<p>Be able to calculate the derivative of polynomials or the derivative of powers with other exponents.</p>

<li><p>Derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions (<a href="{% url 'mithreads-thread' 'math1241' %}#derivatives_exponential_logarithms">See section from the Math 1241 thread</a>)</p>

<p>Be able to calculate the derivative of the exponential function and the logarithm.</p>

</li>

<li><p>Differentiation rules  (<a href="{% url 'mithreads-thread' 'math1241' %}#differentiation_rules">See section from the Math 1241 thread</a>)</p>

<ol>
 <li>Be able to calculate the derivative of the product and quotient of
  two functions.</li>
 
<li>Be able to calculate the derivative of simple compositions, especially those of the form $f(x)=e^{p(x)}$ or $f(x)=\ln(p(x))$, where $p(x)$ is a polynomial.</li>
</ol>

</li>

<li><p>The second derivative and graphing</p>

<ol>

  <li>Be able to calculate critical points: points where the derivative is
    zero or the function is not differentiable.</li>

  <li>The sign of the derivative tells where the function is increasing
  and decreasing.</li>

  <li>Be able to calculate the second derivative of a function.</li>
  <li>The second derivative gives inflections points and tells where the
  function is concave up or down.</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li><p>Partial derivatives (<a href="{% url 'mithreads-thread' 'math1241' %}#partial_derivatives">See section from the Math 1241 thread</a>)</p>

  </p>The partial derivative is just like the ordinary derivative, where
  you hold all variables but one constant. </p>

  <p>Be able to describe what a partial derivative means in the context
  of an example.</p>
</li>
