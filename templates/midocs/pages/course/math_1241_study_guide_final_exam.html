  <ol>
    <li>What it means for two autonomous differential equations to be
  coupled.</li>  

    <li>Estimating a solution to a two-dimensional differential equation
  using the Forward Euler algorithm</li>

    <li>Understanding the correspondence between the phase plane plot and
  plots versus time.</li>

    <li>Finding equilibria by solving the two equations made by setting the rates of change to zero.</li>

    <li>Plotting nullclines in the phase plane.</li>

    <li>Finding equilibria by finding the points where the nullclines intersect.</li>
