<p class="pre_list">A linear transformation (or a linear map) is a function $\vc{T}: \R^n \to \R^m$ that
  satisfies the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>$\vc{T}(\vc{x}+\vc{y}) = \vc{T}(\vc{x}) +\vc{T}(\vc{y})$</li>
<li>$\vc{T}(a\vc{x}) =  a\vc{T}(\vc{x})$</li>
</ol>
<p>for any vectors $\vc{x}, \vc{y} \in \R^n$ and any scalar $a \in \R$.</p>

<p>It is simple enough to identify whether or not a given function
$\vc{f}(\vc{x})$ is a linear transformation.  Just look at each term
of each component of $\vc{f}(\vc{x})$.  If each of these terms is a
number times one of the components of $\vc{x}$, then $\vc{f}$ is a
linear transformation.</p>

<p>Therefore, the function $$\vc{f}(x,y,z) = (3x-y, 3z, 0, z-2x)$$ is a
linear transformation, while neither 
$$\vc{g}(x,y,z) = (3x-y, 3z+2, 0,z-2x)$$ nor 
$$\vc{h}(x,y,z) = (3x-y, 3xz, 0,z-2x)$$ are linear transformations.
The function $\vc{h}$ has a nonlinear component $3xz$ that  disqualifies it.
What about the function $\vc{g}$?  
It's the second component $3z+2$ that's the problem because the term 2 is a constant that doesn't contain any components of our input vector $(x,y,z)$.</p>

<p>It's easy to see that the function $\vc{g}$ violates the second condition above. 
In particular, if you set $a=0$ in that second condition, you see that each linear transformation must satisfy $$\vc{T}(\vc{0}) = \vc{0}$$
but $\vc{g}(0,0,0) = (0,2,0,0)$.
The condition for a linear transformation is stronger than the condition one learns in grade school for a function whose graph is a line. 
A single variable function $f(x)=ax+b$ is not a linear transformation unless its y-intercept $b$ is zero.</p>

<p>A useful feature of a feature of a linear transformation is that there is a
{% intlink "matrices_linear_transformations" %}one-to-one correspondence{%endintlink%} 
between matrices and linear transformations, based on
{% intlink "matrix_vector_multiplication" %}matrix vector multiplication{%endintlink%}.  
So, we can talk without ambiguity of <b>the</b> matrix associated with a linear transformation $\vc{T}(\vc{x})$.
