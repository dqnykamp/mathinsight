<p>Given the rules of {% intlink "matrix_vector_multiplication" %}matrix
multiplication{%endintlink%}, we cannot multiply two vectors when they
are both viewed as {% intlink "matrix_introduction" anchor="vectors_as_matrices" %}column matrices{%endintlink%}.
If we try to multiply an $n \times 1$ matrix with another $n \times 1$ matrix, this product is not defined. 
The number of columns of the first matrix (1) does not match the number of rows of the second matrix ($n$).  
To rectify this problem, we can take the {% intlink "matrix_transpose" %}transpose{%endintlink%}
of the first vector, turning it into a $1 \times n$ row matrix.
With this change, the product is well defined; the product of a $1
\times n$ matrix with an $n \times 1$ matrix is a $1 \times 1$ matrix,
i.e., a scalar. </p>

<p>
If we multiply $\vc{x}^T$ (a $1 \times n$ matrix)
with any $n$-dimensional vector $\vc{y}$ (viewed as an $n \times 1$
matrix), we end up with a matrix multiplication equivalent to the familiar dot product of $\vc{x} \cdot \vc{y}$:
\begin{align*}
  \vc{x}^T \vc{y} =   \left[
    \begin{array}{ccccc}
      x_1&amp;
      x_2&amp;
      x_3&amp;
      \cdots&amp;
      x_n
    \end{array}
  \right]
  \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      y_1\\
      y_2\\
      y_3\\
      \vdots\\
      y_n
    \end{array}
  \right]
  =x_1y_1+x_2y_2+x_3y_3 + \ldots + x_ny_n = \vc{x} \cdot \vc{y}.
\end{align*}
Although we won't typically write a dot product as $\vc{x}^T \vc{y}$,
you may see it elsewhere.  
Moreover, you can view this dot product as forming the
building block for the general {% intlink "matrix_vector_multiplication" %}matrix multiplication{%endintlink%}.
