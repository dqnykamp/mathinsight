<p>The {% intlink "matrices_determinants_multivariable_calculus" %}determinant of a square matrix{%endintlink%} is a single number that, among other things,
can be related to {% intlink "relationship_determinants_area_volume" %}the area or volume of a region{%endintlink%}.
In particular, the determinant of a matrix reflects how the {% intlink "matrices_linear_transformations" %}linear transformation associated with the matrix{%endintlink%} can {% intlink "determinant_linear_transformation" %}scale or reflect objects{%endintlink%}.  
Here we sketch three properties of determinants that can be understood in this geometric context.</p>

{% navigation_tag "scaling" "Scaling" %}
<h4>The effect of scaling a matrix</h4>

<p>Since a linear transformation {% intlink "matrices_linear_transformations" %}can always be written{%endintlink%} as $\vc{T}(\vc{x}) = A\vc{x}$ for some matrix $A$, applying a linear transformation to a vector $\vc{x}$ is the same thing as multiplying by a matrix. 
For square matrices $A$, the absolute value of the determinant captures how applying $\vc{T}$ {% intlink "determinant_linear_transformation" %}expands or compresses objects{%endintlink%}.  
The nature of the expansion or compression depends on the underlying dimension.
One-dimensional linear transformations expand length by a factor $| \det(A)|$, two-dimensional linear transformations expand area by a factor $| \det(A)|$, and three-dimensional linear transformations expand volume by a factor $| \det(A)|$.
</p>

<p>How would the expansion of the linear transformation be affected if we scaled $A$?  For example, if we doubled every entry of $A$, forming the matrix $B=2A$, how would the expansion of the linear transformation $\vc{\tilde{T}}=B\vc{x}$ compare with that of the original $\vc{T} = A\vc{x}$? 
In one dimension, the effect of doubling every vector would simply double the expansion of length by $\vc{\tilde{T}}$.
But, in two dimensions, doubling both components of every vector would lead to increasing the area expansion of $\vc{\tilde{T}}$ by a factor of $2^2=4$, 
compared to the area expansion of $\vc{T}$.
Similarly, doubling every component of the matrix associated with a three-dimensional $\vc{\tilde{T}}$ would expand volume $2^3=8$ times more than the original $\vc{T}$.  Doubling every dimension of a three-dimensional object must lead to the eight-fold increase in volume.</p>

<p>Since this expansion is captured by $|\det(A)|$, we conclude that $|\det(2A)| = 2 |\det(A)|$ in one-dimension, $|\det(2A)| = 2^2 |\det(A)|$ in two-dimensions, and  $|\det(2A)| = 2^3 |\det(A)|$ in three-dimensions. 
It turns out this works in higher dimensions (where a linear transformation expands higher-dimensional volume), and $|\det(2A)| = 2^n |\det(A)|$ in for an $n \times n$ matrix $A$.</p>

<p>There was, of course, nothing special about the number 2.  
By the same geometric argument, if we multiply every component of the matrix $A$ by a positive number $c$, we will change the resulting expansion of $\vc{T}$ by the factor $c$  in each of it dimensions.  For an $n$-dimensional linear transformation, this multiplication will change its overall expansion by the factor $c^n$.  Hence, we can conclude that for an $n \times n$ matrix $A$, 
$$|\det(cA)| = c^n |\det(A)|.$$</p>


<p>What about negative numbers and the sign of the determinant?  The sign of the determinant determines whether a linear transformation {% intlink "determinant_linear_transformation" %}preserves or reverses orientation{%endintlink%}.  In one dimension, multiplying the one component of the matrix by a negative number would correspond to reflecting in that one dimension.  Therefore, multiply by a negative number would change the size of the determinant.  We can conclude that for one dimension, $\det(cA)=c\det(A)$ for any number $c$. 
(This result is painfully obvious since the determinant is just equal to the one number of $A$, but we discuss the one-dimensional case just to give intuition on higher dimensions.)</p>

<p>In two dimensions, the situation is different.  If we multiplied every component of $A$ by a negative number, the change would correspond to flipping an object once across the $x$-axis and then once across the $y$-axis.  
Each of these reflections would change the orientation, but the two reflections cancel each other out.  We cannot change the influence of a two-dimensional linear transformation $\vc{T}$ on orientation through multiplying all components of its matrix $A$ by a negative number.  Combining this result with the expansion due to the magntiude of $c$, we conclude that $\det(cA) = c^2\det(A)$ in two dimensions. This equation summarizes how multiplication by a number cannot change the determinant sign in two dimensions.</p>

<p>In three-dimensions, multiplying the matrix $A$ by a negative number does change the influence of $\vc{T}$ on orientation.  
The net effect of a reflection across each of the three coordinate axes would still be a change of orientation.  Since any odd number of reflections would change orientation, we see that multiplying the determinant by $c^n$ will capture the effect on orientation in $n$-dimensions.  We conclude that for an $n \times $n matrix $A$ and a real number $c$, 
\begin{gather}\det(cA) = c^n \det(A).\end{gather}</p>

<h4>The effect of multiplying matrices</h4>

<p>The geometric interpretation allows us to quickly infer the determinant of a product $AB$ for $n\times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$.
If we apply the linear transformation $\vc{S}(\vc{x}) = AB\vc{x}$ to an object, it's the same thing as first applying the linear transformation $\vc{\tilde{T}}(\vc{x}) = B\vc{x}$ and then applying the linear transformation $\vc{T}(\vc{x}) = A \vc{x}$.  (This follows from the fact that matrix multiplication is associative.)</p>

<p>Since $\vc{T}$ expands by a factor of $|\det(A)|$ and $\vc{\tilde{T}}$ expands by a factor $|\det(B)|$, applying both transformations in succession must expand by a factor $|\det(A)||\det(B)|$.  Moreover, the combination of the two transformations can reverse orientation only if just one of $\vc{T}$ or $\vc{\tilde{T}}$ orientation.  We can summarize these observations with an equation for $\det(AB)$ that reflects the properties of the combined linear transformation $\vc{S}$:
\begin{gather}\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B).\end{gather}
</p>

{% navigation_tag "inverse" "Inverse" %}
<h4>The determinant of a matrix inverse</h4>

<p>If one applies the linear transformation $\vc{T}(\vc{x})=A\vc{x}$ to an object, then applying the the linear transformation $\vc{T}^{-1}(\vc{x}) = A^{-1}\vc{x}$ should map everything back to the original object.  Since $\vc{T}$ expands by the factor $|\det{A}|$, then $\vc{T}^{-1}$ must do the reverse, expanding by the factor $1/|\det(A)|$.  The linear transformation $\vc{T}^{-1}$ must also reverse orientation just when $\vc{T}$ reverses orientation.  In other words, the determinant of $A^{-1}$ must be related to the determinant of $A$ by
\begin{gather}\det(A^{-1}) = \frac{1}{\det(A)}.\end{gather}
