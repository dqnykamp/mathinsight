<p>Let $A$ be a $2 \times 3$ matrix, say
\begin{align*}
  A = \left[
    \begin{array}{rrr}
      1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1\\
      3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
    \end{array}
  \right].
\end{align*}
What do you get if you multiply $A$ by the vector $\vc{x}=(x,y,z)$?
Remembering {% intlink "matrix_vector_multiplication" %}matrix multiplication{%endintlink%}, we see that
\begin{align*}
  A\vc{x} = 
  \left[
    \begin{array}{rrr}
      1 &amp; 0 &amp; -1\\
      3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
    \end{array}
  \right]
  \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      x\\
      y\\
      z
    \end{array}
  \right]
  =
  \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      x - z\\
      3x + y +2z
    \end{array}
  \right]
  =(x-z,3x+y+2z).
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
If we define a function $\vc{f}(\vc{x}) = A\vc{x}$, we have created a
function of three variables $(x,y,z)$ whose output is a
two-dimensional vector $(x-z,3x+y+2z)$.  Using 
{% intlink "function_notation" %}function notation{%endintlink%}, we can
write $\vc{f} : \R^3 \to \R^2$.  We have created a
vector-valued function of three variables.  So, for example,
$\vc{f}(1,2,3) = (1-3,3\cdot 1 + 2 + 2 \cdot 3) = (-2, 11)$.
</p>

<p>
Given any $m \times n$ matrix $B$, we can define a function $\vc{g}:
\R^n \to \R^m$ (note the order of $m$ and $n$
switched) by $\vc{g}(\vc{x}) = B \vc{x}$, where $\vc{x}$ is an
$n$-dimensional vector.  As another example, if
\begin{align*}
    C = \left[
    \begin{array}{rr}
      5 &amp; -3\\
      1 &amp; 0\\
      -7 &amp; 4\\
      0 &amp; -2
    \end{array}
  \right],
\end{align*}
then the function $\vc{h}(\vc{y}) = C \vc{y}$, where $y=(y_1, y_2)$, is $\vc{h}(\vc{y}) = (5y_1-3y_2,y_1,-7y_1+4y_2,-2y_2)$.
</p>

<p>
In this way, we can associate with every matrix a function.  What
about going the other way around?  Given some function, say $\vc{g}:
\R^n \to \R^m$, can we associate with $\vc{g}(\vc{x})$ some matrix?
We can only if $\vc{g}(\vc{x})$ is a special kind of function called a
{% intlink "linear_transformation_definition_euclidean" %}linear transformation{%endintlink%}.
The function $\vc{g}(\vc{x})$ is a linear
transformation if each term of each component of
$\vc{g}(\vc{x})$ is a number times one of the variables.  So, for
example, the functions $\vc{f}(x,y)=(2x+y,y/2)$ and
$\vc{g}(x,y,z)=(z,0,1.2 x)$ are linear transformation, but none of the following
functions are: $\vc{f}(x,y)=(x^2,y,x)$,
$\,\vc{g}(x,y,z)=(y,xyz)$, or $\vc{h}(x,y,z)=(x+1,y,z)$.  Note that
both functions we obtained from matrices above were linear transformations.
</p>

<p>
Let's take the function $\vc{f}(x,y)=(2x+y,y,x-3y)$, which is a linear
transformation from $\R^2$ to $\R^3$.  The matrix $A$ associated with
$\vc{f}$ will be a $3 \times 2$ matrix, which we'll write as 
\begin{align*}
    A = 
  \left[
    \begin{array}{cc}
      a_{11} &amp; a_{12}\\
      a_{21} &amp; a_{22}\\
      a_{31} &amp; a_{32}
    \end{array}
  \right].
\end{align*}
We need $A$ to satisfy $\vc{f}(\vc{x})=A\vc{x}$, where $\vc{x}=(x,y)$.
</p>

<p>
The easiest way to find $A$ is the following.  If we let
$\vc{x}=(1,0)$, then $f(\vc{x})= A\vc{x}$ is the first column of $A$.  (Can you
see that?)  So we know the first column of $A$ is simply 
\begin{align*}
  f(1,0)=(2,0,1) = 
  \left[
    \begin{array}{r}
      2\\0\\1
    \end{array}
  \right].
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
Similarly, if $\vc{x}=(0,1)$, then $f(\vc{x})=A\vc{x}$ is the second column of
$A$, which is
\begin{align*}
  f(0,1) = (1,1,-3) = 
  \left[
    \begin{array}{r}
      1\\1\\-3
    \end{array}
  \right].
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
Putting these together, we see that
the linear transformation $\vc{f}(\vc{x})$ is associated with the matrix
\begin{align*}
  A=
  \left[
    \begin{array}{rr}
      2 &amp; 1\\
      0 &amp; 1\\
      1 &amp; -3
   \end{array}
  \right].
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
The important conclusion is that every linear transformation is associated
with a matrix and vice versa.</p>
