{% boxedvideo exponential_growth_decay_discrete_dynamical_systems %}

<p>In the {% intlink discrete_dynamical_system_introduction %}introduction to discrete dynamical systems{%endintlink%}, we discussed the simplest type of discrete dynamical system, where the {% intlink state_space_definition %}state space{%endintlink%} was one-dimensional and the evolution rule at each time point depended just on the values of the {% intlink state_variable_definition%}state variables{%endintlink%} at that time.  If we let $x_t$ be the snapshot of the state variable at time $t$, then then the {% intlink trajectory_dynamical_systems_definition %}trajectory{%endintlink%} of a given initial state $x_0$ is determined by iterating some function $f(x)$.  The result is  {% intlinkeq discrete_dynamical_system_introduction recursion %}from the introduction{% endintlinkeq %}, which we rewrite here as:
\begin{gather}
  x_{t+1}=f(x_t) \quad \text{for $t=0,1,2,3, \ldots.$ }
  \label{recursion}
\end{gather}
</p>

<p>What is the simplest form for the function $f(x)$?  The boring simplest case would be $f(x)=c$ for some constant $c$.  But in those cases, nothing much happens, as all $x_t=c$.</p>

<p>In the next simplest case $f(x)$ is a linear function of the form
$$f(x) = Rx$$
where $R$ is some fixed positive constant.
In this case, the state variable $x_{t+1}$ at time $t+1$ is proportional to the state variable $x_t$ at the previous time.  The behavior of the trajectory $x_1,x_2,x_3, \ldots$ depends on whether $R$ is larger or small than one.  The case $R=1$ is a special case since then $x_{t+1}=x_t$.  Since in this case, the state variable doesn't change from one snapshot in time to the next, we immediately know that $x_t=x_0$ for all $t$ and we never move from the initial condition value $x_0$. </p>

<p>The more interesting cases are when $R \ne 1$ so that the state variables change over time.  If $R \gt 1$, then the state variable becomes larger in magnitude after each time step.  But if $0 \lt R \lt 1$, then the state variable decreases in magnitude after each time step.  As we will show, these cases correspond to exponential growth and exponential decay, respectively, of the state variable as time increases.</p>

{% navigation_tag "solving" "Solving" %}
<h4>Solving the dynamical system</h4>

<p>If $f(x)=Rx$, we can write the discrete dynamical system as
\begin{align}
  x_{t+1} &= Rx_t \quad \text{for $t=0,1,2,3,\ldots.$}\notag\\
  x_0 &= \text{a known value}.
  {% equation_tag linear_dynamical_system 2 %}
\end{align}
A <em>solution</em> to the dynamical system \eqref{linear_dynamical_system} is a formula for computing $x_t$ solely in terms of the time $t$ and initial conditions $x_0$.  The given system \eqref{linear_dynamical_system} is a recipe for computing all $x_t$, but it is not considered a solution since it is not a formula that lets us directly compute $x_t$ for any $t$.</p>

<p>As discussed in the {% intlink discrete_dynamical_system_introduction %}discrete dynamical systems introduction{%endintlink%}, we can compute the value of $x_t$ for any $t$ by starting with the initial condition $x_0$ and iterating the function many times.  In the general case, the expression for the iteration got pretty messy.  But, for our special case of $f(x)=Rx$, we can write the result with a nice formula.</p>

<p>Starting with $x_0$, we see that 
\begin{align*}
x_{1}=Rx_0,
\end{align*}
which is just equation \eqref{linear_dynamical_system} for case when $t=0$.  Since equation \eqref{linear_dynamical_system} for case when $t=1$ is $x_2=Rx_1$, we just need to multiply by $R$ twice to go from $x_0$ to $x_2$:
\begin{align*}
x_{2}=Rx_1 = R(Rx_0)= R^2x_0.
\end{align*}
We can continue this procedure to calculate $x_t$ for later times $t$:
\begin{align*}
  x_{3}&=Rx_2 = R(Rx_1) = R(R(Rx_0))= R^3x_0\\
  x_{4}&=Rx_3 = R(Rx_2) = R(R(Rx_1))= R(R(R(Rx_0)))=R^4x_0.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>There's no need to stop at $t=4$ or any particular value of $t$, as we can continue this process as long as we want.  For any positive integer $n$, if we want to know $x_n$, the state variable for $t=n$, we would just start with $x_0$ and continuing multiplying by $R$ until we've done it $n$ times.  We have the simple formula
\begin{align*}
  x_n = R^n x_0.
\end{align*}
Or, if we prefer, we can write it in terms of the integer time $t$
\begin{align}
  x_t = R^t x_0.
  {% equation_tag solution 3 %}
\end{align}
Equation \eqref{solution} is the solution to the dynamical system \eqref{linear_dynamical_system}.  It is a simple formula that allows us to immediately compute $x_t$ from the initial condition $x_0$.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it is more natural to think of the dynamical system \eqref{linear_dynamical_system} in terms of the <em>change</em> of the state variable in time $t$: $x_{t+1}-x_t$.  In that case, we can rewrite \eqref{linear_dynamical_system} as
\begin{align}
  x_{t+1} -x_t &= rx_t \quad \text{for $t=0,1,2,3,\ldots.$}\notag\\
  x_0 &= \text{a known value}.
  {% equation_tag linear_dynamical_system_change 4 %}
\end{align}
where $r=R-1$.  We can rewrite the solution \eqref{solution} in terms of $r$ as
\begin{align}
  x_t = (r+1)^t x_0.
  {% equation_tag solution2 5 %}
\end{align}
</p>

<p>The case $r \gt 0$ corresponds $R \gt 1$, and the solution exhibits exponential growth.  The state variable $x_t$ will blow up to very large magnitude numbers as the time $t$ increases.  The case $-1 \lt r \lt 0$ corresponds to $0 \lt R \le 1$, and the solution exhibits exponential decay.  The state variable $x_t$ will decay toward zero as the time $t$ increases.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
{% navigation_tag "humanexample" "Examples" "Human population growth" %}
<h5>Human population growth</h5>

<p>Suppose a human population is growing at 1% per year and initially has
1,000,000 individuals.  Let $P_t$ denote the populations size $t$ years after the initial population of $P_0 = 1,000,000$ individuals. If one asks what the population will be in 50 years there are two options.</p>

<p><b>Option 1.</b>  At 1% per year growth, the dynamic equation would
be 
\begin{gather*}
P_{t+1} - P_t    = 0.01 \, P_t
\end{gather*}
and the corresponding iteration
equation is
\begin{gather*}
P_{t+1} = 1.01 \, P_t
\end{gather*}
Starting with the initial condition, $P_0 = 1,000,000$, we could calculate $P_1 = 1.01 \times 1,000,000 = 1,010,000$,
$P_2 = 1.01 \times 1,010,000 = 1,020,100$ and so on for 50 iterations.
</p>

<p><b>Option 2.</b>  Alternatively, one may write the solution
\begin{gather*}
P_t = 1.01^t \left( 1,000,000 \right)
\end{gather*}
so that we immediately have a formula for the population after 50 years:
\begin{gather*}
P_{50} = 1.01^{50} \left( 1,000,000 \right) = 1,644,631.
\end{gather*}
</p>

<h5>Bacteria growth</h5>

<p>When nutrients are plentiful and the population size isn't too large, a bacteria can exhibit exponential growth.  See {% intlink bacteria_growth_initial_model %}this page{%endintlink%} for details on developing an exponential growth model from data and solving it.</p>

{% navigation_tag "penicillinexample" "Examples" "Penicillin clearance" %}
<h5>Penicillin clearance</h5>

<p>If penicillin is given as a {% extlink "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_%28medicine%29" %}bolus{%endextlink%} injection (a one-time injection) and the kidneys remove a fixed fraction of the penicillin every 5 minutes, the amount of penicillin in the blood exhibits exponential decay.  See {% intlink penicillin_clearance_model %}this page{%endintlink%} for the steps to develop such an exponential decay model from data.</p>

{% navigation_tag "chocolatedecay" "Examples" "Chocolate decay" %}
<h5>Chocolate decay</h5>

<p>I start with 2 chocolate bars.  Every day, I eat 10% of the chocolate that I started the day with.  Write down a dynamical system describing the chocolate I have left after each day and determine how much chocolate I have left after two weeks.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: Let $c_t$ be the amount of chocolate (in units of a chocolate bar) that I have after $t$ days.  The dynamical system that $c_t$ follows is
\begin{align*}
  c_{t+1} - c_t &= 0.1 c_t\\
  c_0 &= 2.
\end{align*}
In iteration form, the system is $c_{t+1}= 0.9c_t$, and its solution is
\begin{gather*}
  c_t = 0.9^t c_0 = 0.9^t 2.
\end{gather*}
</p>

<p>After two weeks, the chocolate I have left is
\begin{gather*}
  c_{14} = 0.9^{14}2 \approx 0.46 \text{ chocolate bars}.
\end{gather*}
</p>
