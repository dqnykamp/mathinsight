<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

<p>Write a solution equation for the following discrete dynamical systems.  In each case, compute the solution at time $t=100$.
\begin{align*}
{\rm{a.}} \hspace{2mm} x_0 & = 1,000  & x_{t+1} - x_t & =  0.2 \times x_t  \\
{\rm{b.}} \hspace{2mm} x_0 & = 138   & x_{t+1} - x_t & =  0.05 \times x_t  \\
{\rm{c.}} \hspace{2mm} B_0 & = 138  & B_{t+1} - B_t & =  0.5 \times B_t  \\
{\rm{d.}} \hspace{2mm} y_0 & = 1,000 & y_{t+1} - y_t & = -0.2 \times y_t  \\
{\rm{e.}} \hspace{2mm} P_0 & = 1,000 & P_{t+1}  & =  1.2 \times P_t  \\

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Suppose a population is initially of size 1,000,000 and grows at the rate of 2% per year.  What will be the size of the population after 50 years?</p>

<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>The polymerase chain reaction is a means of making multiple copies of a DNA segment from only a minute amount of original DNA.  The procedure consists of a sequence of multiple cycles.  During the course of one cycle, each DNA segment present is duplicated.  Introduce notation and write a discrete dynamical system with initial condition from which the amount of DNA present at the end of each cycle can be computed.  Suppose you begin with 1 picogram = 0.000000000001 g of DNA.  How many grams of DNA would be present after 30 cycles.</p>
