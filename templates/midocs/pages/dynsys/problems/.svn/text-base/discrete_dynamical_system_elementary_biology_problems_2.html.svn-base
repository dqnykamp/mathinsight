<h4>Problem {{probnum}}</h4>

<p>Let $x_n$ be the number of fish in generation $n$ in a lake.  We'll model the evolution of the fish using Ricker's model of the form
\begin{align*}
  x_{n+1} = 5x_n e^{-x_n},
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>The equilibria of this model are $x_n=0$ and $x_n= \ln(5)$.  
<ol>
  <li>Calculate the stability of the equilibria using calculus.</li>
  <li>Confirm the stability through cobwebbing the below graph.</li>
  <li>For any positive initial fish population $x_0$, what will happen to the fish population $x_n$ as $n$ gets large?</li>

<h4>Problem {{probnum}}</h4>

<p>A population of squirrels would be increasing at rate of 50% per year, except that due to a scarcity of acorns, there is only enough food to support 300 squirrels.  Therefore, if $s_t$ is the number of squirrels in year $t$, the population evolves according to the dynamical system
\begin{align*}
  s_{t+1} - s_{t} = 0.5 s_t\left(1 - \frac{s_t}{300}\right).
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>Calculate the equilibria of the dynamical system and their stability.  If the initial population is $s_0=400$, what will happen to the population after a long time?</p>

<p>A population of squirrels would be increasing at rate of $r$ per year, except that due to a scarcity of acorns, there is only enough food to support $N$ squirrels.  Therefore, if $s_t$ is the number of squirrels in year $t$, the population evolves according to the dynamical system
\begin{align*}
  s_{t+1} - s_{t} = r s_t\left(1 - \frac{s_t}{N}\right).

<h4>Problem {{probnum}}</h4>

<p>A population of deer is growing exponentially so that in each year the population increases by 20%.  In order to keep the population from exploding, a number of deer is harvested annually that is proportional to the square of the population.  If $d_t$ is the number of deer in year $t$, the population follows the dynamical system
\begin{align*}
  d_{t+1}=1.2 d_t - c d_t^2
\end{align*}
where $c$ is a positive parameter that determines the amount of harvesting.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the equilibria of this system.</li>
  <li>Calculate the stability of the equilibria.</li>
  <li>How does the stability of the equilibria depend on the parameter $c$?</li>
  <li>For what value of $c$ is there a stable equilibrium of 200 deer?</li>

<h4>Problem {{probnum}}</h4>

<p>A population of locusts is growing out of control, so that the number of locusts is quadupling each year.  In attempt to limit the population, each year a number of locusts is killed that is proportional to the square of the population.  If $l_t$ is the number of locusts in year $t$, the population follows the dynamical system
\begin{align*}
  l_{t+1}=4 l_t - c l_t^2
\end{align*}
where $c$ is a positive parameter that determines the amount of harvesting.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the equilibria of this system.</li>
  <li>Calculate the stability of the equilibria.</li>
  <li>How does the stability of the equilibria depend on the parameter $c$?</li>
  <li>Will this strategy succeed in bringing the number of locusts to a stable small population? </li>
