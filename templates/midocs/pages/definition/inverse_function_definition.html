<p>An inverse function is a function that undoes the action of the another function.  A function $g$ is the inverse of a function $f$ if whenever $y=f(x)$ then $x=g(y)$.  In other words, applying $f$ and then $g$ is the same thing as doing nothing.  We can write this in terms of the {% intlink "composition_definition" %}composition{%endintlink%} of $f$ and $g$ as $g(f(x))=x$.</p>

<p>A function $f$ has an inverse function only if for every $y$ in its {% intlink "range_definition" %}range{%endintlink%} there is only one value of $x$ in its {% intlink "domain_definition" %}domain{%endintlink%} for which $f(x)=y$.  This inverse function is unique and is frequently denoted by $f^{-1}$ and called &ldquo;$f$ inverse.&rdquo; </p>
