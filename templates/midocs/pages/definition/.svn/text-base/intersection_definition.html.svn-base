{% description "The intersection of a set $A$ with a $B$ is the set of elements that are in both set $A$ and $B$.  The intersection is denoted as $A \cap B$." %}

<p>The intersection of a set $A$ with a $B$ is the set of elements that are in both set $A$ and $B$.  The intersection is denoted as $A \cap B$.</p>

<p>For example, if $A$ is the set $\{ \diamondsuit, \heartsuit, \clubsuit,  \spadesuit \}$ and $B$ is the set $\{ \triangle, \heartsuit,  \spadesuit \}$, then $A \cap B = \{\heartsuit,  \spadesuit \}$. Or if $I_1$ is the interval $[0,2]$ and $I_2$ is the interval $[1,3]$, then $I_1 cap I_2 = [1,2]$.</p>
