{% description "In a network, the mean path length is the average shortest path between two nodes." %}

<p>In a {% intlink network_definition%}network{%endintlink%}, the mean path length is the average shortest path between two nodes.</p>

<p>Let $d_{ij}$ be the length of the shortest path between nodes $i$ and $j$. In a network, the length of a path is the number of edges that the path contains.  The shortest path between two points is called <em>geodesic</em>.  There will typically be many geodesics between a pair of nodes, but, by definition, they will all have the same length $d_{ij}$.</p>

<p>The <em>mean path length</em> is the average of the shortest path length, averaged over all pairs of nodes.  For an {% intlink undirected_graph_definition%}undirected graph{%endintlink%} of $N$ nodes, the mean path length is
\begin{gather*}
  \ell = \frac{1}{N(N-1)} \sum_{i \ne j} d_{ij},
\end{gather*}
where the sum is over all pairs of distinct nodes.</p>

<p>If two nodes are disconnected, meaning there is no path between them, then the path length between them in infinite.  As a consequence, if a network contains disconnected components (collections of nodes that have no paths between them), then the mean path length $\ell$ also diverges to infinity.  One way to avoid this problem is to calculate $\ell$ only from nodes in the largest connected component.</p>

Another way is to use a different measure that avoids this problem, the {% intlink network_efficiency_definition %}efficiency{% endintlink%} of a graph.</p>
