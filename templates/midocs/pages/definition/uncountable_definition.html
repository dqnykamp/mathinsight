{% description "A set is uncountable if it contains so many elements that they cannot be put in one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers.  In other words, there is no way that one can count off all elements in the set in such a way that, even though the counting will take forever, you will get to any particular element in a finite amount of time." %}

<p>A set is uncountable if it contains so many elements that they cannot be put in one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers.  In other words, there is no way that one can count off all elements in the set in such a way that, even though the counting will take forever, you will get to any particular element in a finite amount of time.</p>

<p>Uncountable is in contrast to {% intlink countably_infinite_definition %}countably infinite{%endintlink%} or countable.</p>

<p>For example, the set of real numbers in the interval $[0,1]$ is uncountable.  There are a continuum of numbers in that interval, and that is too many to be put in a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers.  One can show using  {% extlink "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument"%}Cantor's diagonal argument{%endextlink%} that for any infinite list of numbers in the interval $[0,1]$, there will always be numbers in $[0,1]$ that are not on the list.</p>
