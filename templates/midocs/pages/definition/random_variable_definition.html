<p>A random variable is a variable that is subject to random variations so that it can take on multiple different values, each with an associated probability.</p>

<p>A random variable could be {% intlink "probability_distribution_idea" anchor="discrete" %}discrete{%endintlink%}, such as in the result of rolling a six-sided die.  A random variable $X$ modeling the result of such an experiment would take on a value from the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$, each with probability $1/6$.</p>

<p>A random variable could also be {% intlink "probability_distribution_idea" anchor="continuous" %}continuous{%endintlink%}, such as in the result of randomly choosing a number between 0 and 1.  A random variable modeling the result of such an experiment could take on any real number in the interval $[0,1]$, where each number would be equally likely.</p>
