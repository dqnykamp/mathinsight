{% description "By one definition, a graph is network, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together.  A graph can also refer to a function graph, i.e., a plot of a function." %}

<p>The term <em>graph</em> can refer to two completely different things.  Students usually first learn of a graph as plot of a function, or a {% intlink "function_graph_definition" %}function graph{%endintlink%}.  Here, we refer to a different definition of graph, in which a graph is another word for a {% intlink "network_definition" %}network{%endintlink%},  i.e., a set of objects (called {% intlink "graph_vertex_definition" %}vertices{%endintlink%} or {% intlink "network_node_definition" %}nodes{%endintlink%}) that are connected together.  The connections between the vertices are called {% intlink "network_edge_definition" %}edges{%endintlink%} or {% intlink "network_link_definition" %}links{%endintlink%}.</p>

<p>If the edges in a graph are directed, i.e., pointing in only one direction, the graph is called a {% intlink "directed_graph_definition" %}directed graph{%endintlink%}, or sometimes <em>digraph</em> for short.  When drawing a directed graph, the edges are typically drawn as arrows indicating the direction, as illustrated in the first figure, below.  If all edges are bidirectional, or undirected, the graph is an {% intlink "undirected_graph_definition" %}undirected graph{%endintlink%}, as illustrated by the second figure.</p>


{% twocolumns 50 2 "padding-top:1em;" 1 %}
{% image "small_directed_network_labeled" %}
<p>A directed graph with 10 vertices (or nodes) and 13 edges (or links).</p>
{% nextcolumn %}
{% image "small_undirected_network_labeled" %}
<p>An undirected graph with 10  and 11 edges (or links).</p>
{% endtwocolumns %}


<p>One can formally define an undirected graph as $G= (\mathcal{N},\mathcal{E})$, consisting of the set $\mathcal{N}$ of nodes and the set $\mathcal{E}$ of edges, which are unordered pairs of elements of $\mathcal{N}$.  The formal definition of a directed graph is similar, the only difference is that the set $\mathcal{E}$ contains ordered pairs  of elements of $\mathcal{N}$. </p>
