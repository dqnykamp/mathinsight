<p>The codomain of a {% intlink "function_definition" %}function{%endintlink%} is the set of its possible outputs.  In the {% intlink "function_machine" %}function machine{%endintlink%} metaphor, the codomain is the set of objects that might possible come out of the machine.</p>


<p>For example, when we use the {% intlink "function_notation" %}function notation{%endintlink%} $f: \R \to \R$, we mean that $f$ is a function from the real numbers to the real numbers.  In other words, the codomain of $f$ is the set of real numbers $\R$ (and its set of possible inputs or {% intlink "domain_definition" %}domain{%endintlink%} is also the set of real numbers $\R$).</p>

<p>Just because an object is in the codomain of a function, it does not necessarily mean that there is an input for which the function will output that object.  For example, we could define a function $f: \R \to \R$ as $f(x)=x^2$.  Since $f(x)$ will always be non-negative, the number $-3$ is in the codomain of $f$, but there is no input of $x$ for which $f(x)=-3$.  The set of all outputs that result from putting all inputs into the function is called the {% intlink "range_definition" %}range{%endintlink%}.  For the above $f$, the range is the set of non-negative real numbers while the codomain is the set of all real numbers.</p>
