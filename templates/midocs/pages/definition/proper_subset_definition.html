{% description "A proper subset of a set A is a subset of A that is not equal to A.  In other words, if B is a proper subset of A, then all elements of B are in A but A contains at least one element that is not in B." %}

<p>A proper subset of a set $A$ is a {% intlink "subset_definition" %}subset{% endintlink%} of $A$ that is not equal to $A$.  In other words, if $B$ is a proper subset of $A$, then all elements of $B$ are in $A$ but $A$ contains at least one element that is not in $B$.</p>

<p>For example, if $A =\{1,3,5\}$ then $B=\{1,5\}$ is a proper subset of $A$.  The set $C=\{1,3,5\}$ is a subset of $A$, but it is not a proper subset of $A$ since $C=A$.  The set $D=\{1,4\}$ is not even a subset of $A$, since 4 is not an element of $A$.</p>
