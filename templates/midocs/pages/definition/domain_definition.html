<p>The domain of a  {% intlink "function_definition" %}function{%endintlink%} is the set of its possible inputs, i.e., the set of input values where for which the function is defined.  In the {% intlink "function_machine" %}function machine{%endintlink%} metaphor, the domain is the set of objects that the machine will accept as inputs.</p>

<p>For example, when we use the {% intlink "function_notation" %}function notation{%endintlink%} $f: \R \to \R$, we mean that $f$ is a function from the real numbers to the real numbers.  In other words, the domain of $f$ is the set of real number $\R$ (and its set of possible outputs or {% intlink "codomain_definition" %}codomain{%endintlink%} is also the set of real numbers $\R$).</p>

<p>If we just define a function such as $f(x)=\sqrt{x-1}$ and don't explicitly state its domain, we typically assume that the domain is the largest subset of real numbers where $f$ could be define.  In this example, we'd implicitly understand that the domain is the set of real numbers greater than or equal to 1: $\{ x \,|\, x \ge 1 \}$.</p>
