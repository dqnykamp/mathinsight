<p>A simply connected domain is a {% intlink "path_connected_definition" %}path-connected{%endintlink%} domain where one can continuously shrink any {% intlink "simple_curve_definition" %}simple{%endintlink%} {% intlink "closed_curve_definition" %}closed{%endintlink%} curve into a point while remaining in the domain.</p>

<p>For two-dimensional regions, a simply connected domain is one
without holes in it.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "simply_connected_3D" %}</p>

<p>For three-dimensional domains, the concept of simply connected is 
more subtle.  A simply connected domain is one without holes going 
all the way through it.  However, a domain with just a hole in the middle
(like a ball whose center is hollow) is still simply connected, as we can 
continuously shrink any closed curve to a point by going around the
hole and remaining in the domain. 
On the other hand, a ball with a hole drilled all the way through it, 
or a spool with a hollow central axis, is not simply connected.
A closed curve that went around the hole could not be shrunk to a point
while remaining in the domain.  
There is no way for the curve to bypass the the hole so it remains stuck around it.
