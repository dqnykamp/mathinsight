{% description "A directed graph is graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another." %}

<p>A directed graph is {% intlink "graph_definition" %}graph{%endintlink%}, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another.  A directed graph is sometimes called a digraph or a directed {% intlink "network_definition" %}network{%endintlink%}. In contrast, a graph where the edges are bidirectional is called an {% intlink "undirected_graph_definition" %}undirected graph{%endintlink%}.</p>
  
<p>When drawing a directed graph, the edges are typically drawn as arrows indicating the direction, as illustrated in the following figure.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">A directed graph with 10 vertices (or nodes) and 13 edges.</p>


<p>One can formally define a directed graph as $G= (\mathcal{N},\mathcal{E})$, consisting of the set $\mathcal{N}$ of nodes and the set $\mathcal{E}$ of edges, which are ordered pairs of elements of $\mathcal{N}$.  </p>
