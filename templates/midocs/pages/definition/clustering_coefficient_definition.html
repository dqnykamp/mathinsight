<p>The clustering coefficient{% citation "watts_strogatz_n_1998" %} of an {% intlink "undirected_graph_definition" %}undirected graph{%endintlink%} is a measure of the number of triangles in a graph.</p>

<p>The clustering coefficient of a graph is based on a local clustering coefficient for each node
\begin{gather*}
  C_i = \frac{\text{number of triangles connected to node $i$}}{\text{number of triples centered around node $i$}},
\end{gather*}
where a triple centered around node $i$ is a set of two edges connected to node $i$.  (If the degree of node $i$ is 0 or 1, we which gives us $C_i=0/0$, we can set $C_i=0$.)</p>

<p>The clustering coefficient for the whole graph is the average of the local values $C_i$
\begin{gather*}
  C= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n C_i,
\end{gather*}
where $n$ is the number of nodes in the network.</p>

<p>By definition $0 \le C_i \le 1$ and $0 \le C \le 1$.</p>

<p>The clustering coefficient of a graph is closely related to the {% intlink "transitivity_graph_definition" %}transitivity{%endintlink%} of a graph, as both measure the relative frequency of triangles.</p>
