<p>An undirected graph is {% intlink "graph_definition" %}graph{%endintlink%}, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are bidirectional.  An undirected graph is sometimes called  an undirected {% intlink "network_definition" %}network{%endintlink%}. In contrast, a graph where the edges point in a direction  is called a {% intlink "directed_graph_definition" %}directed graph{%endintlink%}.</p>
  
<p>When drawing an undirected graph, the edges are typically drawn as lines between pairs of nodes, as illustrated in the following figure.</p>

<p>One can formally define an undirected graph as $G= (\mathcal{N},\mathcal{E})$, consisting of the set $\mathcal{N}$ of nodes and the set $\mathcal{E}$ of edges, which are unordered pairs of elements of $\mathcal{N}$.  </p>
