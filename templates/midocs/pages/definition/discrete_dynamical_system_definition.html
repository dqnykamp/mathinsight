{% description "A discrete dynamical system is a dynamical system whose state evolves over state space in discrete time steps according to a fixed rule." %}

<p>A discrete dynamical system is a {% intlink "dynamical_system_definition" %}dynamical system{% endintlink%} whose state evolves over state space in discrete time steps according to a fixed rule.</p>
