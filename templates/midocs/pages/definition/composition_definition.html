{% description "The composition of two functions is the function formed by applying the original two functions in succession." %}
<p>The composition $f \circ g$ of two {% intlink "function_definition" %}functions{%endintlink%} $f$ and $g$ is the function formed by first applying the function $g$ and then the function $f$.  In other words, to apply the composition $f \circ g$ to an input $x$, you perform the following two steps.   You first apply the function $g$ to the input $x$ and obtain the result $g(x)$ as the output.  Next, you apply the function $f$ using $g(x)$  as the input and obtain the result $f(g(x))$ as the output.   We can write the composition as $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$.</p>

<p>In the simplest case, the input $x$ and the outputs to the functions are just numbers.  However, the inputs and outputs to functions could be more complicated objects.  If $f$ or $g$ are vector-valued functions, then these objects might instead be {% intlink "vector_introduction" %}vectors{%endintlink%}. </p>

<p>One can illustrate function composition using the {% intlink "function_machine" %}function machine{%endintlink%} metaphor by {% intlink "function_machine_composition" %}connecting function machines together{%endintlink%}.
