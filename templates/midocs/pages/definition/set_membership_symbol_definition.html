<p>The symbol $\in$ indicates set membership and means &ldquo;is an element of&rdquo; so that the statement $x \in A$ means that $x$ is an element of the set $A$.  In other words, $x$ is one of the objects in the collection of (possibly many) objects in the set $A$.</p>

<p>For example, if $A$ is the set $\{ \diamondsuit, \heartsuit, \clubsuit,  \spadesuit \}$, then $\heartsuit \in A$ but $\triangle \notin A$ (where the symbol $\notin$ means &ldquo;not an element of&rdquo;).  Or if $I$ is the interval $[1,2]$, then $x \in I$ means $x$ is some real number in that interval, i.e., $x$ satisfies $1 \le x \le 2$.
