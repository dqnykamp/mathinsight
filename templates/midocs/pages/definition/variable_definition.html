<p>A variable is a quantity that may change within the context of a mathematical problem or experiment.  Typically, we use a single letter to represent a variable.  The letters $x$, $y$, and $z$ are common generic symbols used for variables.  Sometimes, we will choose a letter that reminds us of the quantity it represents, such as $t$ for time, $v$ for voltage, or $b$ for bacteria.</p>
