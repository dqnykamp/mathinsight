<p>A {% intlink "dynamical_system_definition" %}dynamical system{%endintlink%} exhibits chaos if it has solutions that appear to be quite random and the solutions exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions.</p>

<p>The sensitive dependence means that if you performed two experiments evolving the dynamical system where the only difference between the experiments was a slight difference in initial conditions, the resulting two {% intlink "trajectory_dynamical_systems_definition" %}trajectories{%endintlink%} would become very different as time progresses.  (Since the initial conditions {% intlink "dynamical_system_idea" %}completely determine the future states{%endintlink%}, the experiments would be exactly the same if the initial conditions were identical.)  In a real-world system, one wouldn't typically know initial conditions exactly, so chaos in a dynamical system severely limits the ability to predict the future of the system (think weather prediction).</p>

<p>The fact the solutions &ldquo;appear quite random&rdquo; means that if one were to start a whole bunch of experiments with different initial conditions that were all tighly clustered together, the resulting trajectories would eventually be spread all over the state space.</p>
