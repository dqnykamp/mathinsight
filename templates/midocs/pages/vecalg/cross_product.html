{% title "The cross product" %}
{% description "Introduction to the cross product with a focus on its basic properties. Includes an interactive graphic to illustrate these properties of the cross product." %}

<p>We define the cross product of two three-dimensional vectors
  $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$ by the requirements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>$\vc{a} \times \vc{b}$ is a vector that is perpendicular to both
      $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$.</li>
    <li>$\|\vc{a} \times \vc{b}\|$ is the area of the parallelogram
  spanned by $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$ (i.e. the parallelogram whose
  adjacent sides are the vectors $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$).</li>
    <li>The direction of $\vc{a} \times \vc{b}$ is determined by the
  right-hand rule.  (This means that if we curl the fingers of the
  right hand from $\vc{a}$ to $\vc{b}$, then the thumb points in the
  direction of $\vc{a} \times \vc{b}$.)</li>
  </ul>

<p>From simple trigonometry, we can calculate that the area of the
parallelogram spanned by $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$ is
\begin{align*}
\|\vc{a}\| ~ \|\vc{b}\| \sin\theta,
\end{align*}
where $\theta$
is the angle between $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$.  (One can view the
parallelogram as having a base of length $\|\vc{b}\|$ and
perpendicular height $\|\vc{a}\| \sin \theta$, as pictured below.)

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "area_parallelogram" %}</p>

<p>This formula shows that the magnitude of the cross product is
largest when $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$ are perpendicular.  On the other
hand, if $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$ are parallel or if either vector is the
zero vector, then the cross product is the zero vector.  (It is a good
thing that we get the zero vector in these cases so that the above
definition still makes sense.  If the vectors are parallel or one
vector is the zero vector, then there is not a unique line
perpendicular to both $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$.  But since there is only
one vector of zero length, the definition still uniquely determines
the cross product.)</p>

<p>Below is an applet that helps illustrate how the cross product
works.  Although it is admittedly hard to manipulate in a precise
manner, you can convince yourself that the above properties of the
cross product are satisfied by the cross product vector shown in the
applet.</p>


{% boxedapplet "cross_product" %}

<p>Notice that the area of the parallelogram (and hence the magnitude
of the cross product) go to zero as $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$ approach
parallel (where the term &ldquo;parallel&rdquo; also includes what you
might think as anti-parallel).  You can also verify that the applet
demonstrates $\vc{b} \times \vc{a} = - \vc{a} \times \vc{b}$ and $\vc{a}
\times \vc{a} = \vc{0}$, which are important properties of the cross
product.</p>

<p>The geometric definition of the cross product is nice for understanding its properties.  However, it's not too convenient for numerically calculating the cross product of vectors given in terms of their {% intlink "vectors_cartesian_coordinates_2d_3d" %}coordinates{%endintlink%}.  For such calculations, you may want to have the {% intlink "cross_product_formula" %}formula for the cross product{%endintlink%} in terms of components. With the cross product formula in hand, you can make short work of any calculation, as illustrated by {% intlink "cross_product_examples" %}these examples{%endintlink%} of calculating cross products and areas of parallelograms.</p>
