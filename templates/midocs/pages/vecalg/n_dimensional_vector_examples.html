<p>At first, it may seem that going {% intlink "vectors_arbitrary_dimensions" %}beyond three dimensions{%endintlink%} is an
exercise in pointless mathematical abstraction.  One might thing that
if we want to describe something in our physical world, certainly
three dimensions (or possibly four dimensions if we want to think
about time) will be sufficient.  It turns out that this assumption is
far from the truth.  To describe even the simplest objects, we will
typically need more than three dimensions.  In fact, in many
applications of mathematics, it is challenging to develop mathematical
models that can realistically describe a physical system and yet keep
the number of dimensions from becoming incredibly large.
</p>

<p>
The following simple examples reveal how quickly the required number of
dimensions increases as we try to describe physical objects.
</p>

{% navigation_tag "rigidobject" "Examples" "Rigid object" %}
<h4>Position of a rigid object</h4>

<p>
How many dimensions does it take to specify the position of a rigid
object (for example, an airplane) in space?  Naively, one would think
that it would take three dimensions: one each to specify the
$x$-coordinate, $y$-coordinate, and the $z$-coordinate of the object.
It is correct that one needs only three dimensions to specify, for
example, the center of the object.  However, even if the center of a rigid
object is specified, the object could also rotate.  In fact, it can
rotate in three different directions, such as the roll, pitch, and yaw
of an airplane.  Consequently, we need six dimensions to specify the
position of a rigid object: three to specify the location of the
center of the object, and three to specify the direction in which the
object is pointing.
</p>

{% navigation_tag "nonrigid" "Examples" "Non-rigid object" %}
<h4>Non-rigid objects</h4>

<p>
If one considers non-rigid objects, then the number of dimensions
required to specify the configuration of the object can be quite
high.  As a simple example, consider this little guy below.
</p>

{% boxedapplet "stick_figure_position" %}

<p>
For simplicity, he is only a two-dimensional object as he is confined
to lie in the plane of your computer screen.  We've fixed his
position and the direction his body is pointing.  Nonetheless, just to
specify the angles of his arms, legs, and head requires a vector in
nine-dimensional space.   (We'd need even more dimensions if
we also wanted to specify his position or his cholesterol level.)
</p>

{% navigation_tag "neurons" "Examples" "Neurons" %}
<h4>Multidimensional activity of neurons</h4>

<p>We run into high dimensional vectors even in fields like neuroscience.  
Let's say we stick
100 electrodes in the head of our friend Fred, the lab rat, to
simultaneously record the activity of 100 of his neurons.  Right away,
you can see we'll need a 100-dimensional vector to describe Fred's
neuronal activity at any point in time.  It gets worse, though, if you
think about recording Fred's neural activity over an extend period of
time.  Let's say we record from Fred's neurons while he's working for
ten minutes (or 600 seconds).  If we sample his neural activity 1000
times a second, that means we will take $1000 \times 600 =$ 600,000
samples during those ten minutes.  Multiplying that by the 100
neurons, and we see we need a 60,000,000-dimensional vector to
represent Fred's neural activity during those ten minutes.
</p>

<p>
You can see that a three-dimensional vector isn't large enough for
many practical situations.
</p>

<p>Is it harder to think about Fred's head
than to think about a 60,000,000-dimensional vector?
But it is much preferable to put electrodes in Fred's head than in the head
of children suffering with severe epilepsy, as still needs to be done
in some cases.  Won't it be great if we can develop scientific means
to avoid the latter?
