{% description "A introduction to the concept of a vector as an object with magnitude and direction." %}

<p>A vector is an object that has both a magnitude and a direction.  
Geometrically, we can picture a vector as a directed line segment, whose length is the magnitude of the vector and with an arrow indicating the direction. The direction of the vector is from its tail to its head. </p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "vector" %}</p>

<p>Two vectors are the same if they have the same magnitude and direction.  This means that if we take a vector and translate it to a new position (without rotating it), then the vector we obtain at the end of this process is the same vector we had in the beginning.</p>

<p>Two examples of vectors are those that represent force and velocity.  
Both force and velocity are in a particular direction.  The magnitude of the 
vector would indicate the strength of the force or the speed associated with the velocity.</p>


<p>We denote vectors using boldface as in $\vc{a}$ or $\vc{b}$.
Especially when writing by hand where one cannot easily write in
boldface, people will sometimes denote vectors using arrows as in $\vec{a}$ or
$\vec{b}$, or they use other markings.  We won't need to use arrows here.
We denote the magnitude of the vector $\vc{a}$ by $\|\vc{a}\|$.
When we want to refer to a number and stress that it is not a vector,
we can call the number a {% intlink scalar_definition %}scalar{%endintlink%}.  We will denote scalars 
with italics, as in $a$ or $b$.</p>


<p>You can explore the concept of the magnitude and direction of a vector using the below applet.  Note that moving the vector around doesn't change the vector, as the position of the vector doesn't affect the magnitude or the direction.
But if you stretch or turn the vector by moving just its head or its tail, the magnitude or direction will change.  (This applet also shows the coordinates of the vector, which you can read about in {% intlink vectors_cartesian_coordinates_2d_3d %}another page{%endintlink%}.)</p>

{% boxedapplet "vector_magnitude_direction" %}


<p>There is one important exception to vectors having a direction.  The zero
vector, denoted by a boldface $\vc{0}$, is the vector of zero length. 
Since it has no length, it is not pointing in any particular direction.  
There is only one vector of zero length, so we can speak of <b>the</b> zero vector.</p>

<p>We can define a number of operations on vectors geometrically without 
reference to any coordinate system.  Here we define <a href="#addition">addition</a>, <a href="#subtraction">subtraction</a>, and <a href="#scalarmultiplication">multiplication by a scalar</a>.</p>

{% navigation_tag "addition" "Operations" "Addition" %}
<h4>Addition of vectors</h4>

<p>Given two vectors $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$, we form their sum $\vc{a}+\vc{b}$, as follows. 
We translate the vector $\vc{b}$ until its tail coincides with the head of $\vc{a}$.  (Recall such translation does not change a vector.) 
Then, the directed line segment from the tail of $\vc{a}$ to the head of $\vc{b}$ is the vector $\vc{a}+\vc{b}$.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "vector_a_plus_b" %}</p>

<p>The vector addition is the way forces and velocities combine.  For example,
if a car is traveling due north at 20 miles per hour and a child in the back
seat behind the driver throws an object at 20 miles per hour toward his
sibling who is sitting due east of him, then the velocity of the object
(relative to the ground!) will be in a north-easterly direction.
The velocity vectors form a right triangle, where the total velocity is the
hypotenuse.  Therefore, the total speed of the object (i.e., the magnitude of the velocity vector) is $\sqrt{20^2+20^2}=20\sqrt{2}$ 
miles per hour relative to the ground.</p>

<p>Addition of vectors satisfies two important properties.</p>
<ol><li><p>The commutative law, which states the order of addition doesn't matter:
$$\vc{a}+\vc{b}=\vc{b}+\vc{a}.$$
This law is also called the parallelogram law, as illustrated in the below
image.  Two of the edges of the parallelogram define $\vc{a}+\vc{b}$, 
and the other pair of edges define $\vc{b}+\vc{a}$.  But, both sums are
equal to the same diagonal of the parallelogram.</p>
<p class="centeredImage">{% image "vector_parallelogram_law" %}</p>
</li>
<li><p>The associative law, which states that the sum of three vectors does
not depend on which pair of vectors is added first:
$$(\vc{a}+\vc{b})+\vc{c} = \vc{a} + (\vc{b}+\vc{c}).$$</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>You can explore the properties of vector addition with the following applet. (This applet also shows the coordinates of the vectors, which you can read about in {% intlink vectors_cartesian_coordinates_2d_3d %}another page{%endintlink%}.)</p>

{% boxedapplet "vector_sum" %}

{% navigation_tag "subtraction" "Operations" "Subtraction" %}
<h4>Vector subtraction</h4>

<p>Before we define subtraction, we define the vector $-\vc{a}$, which 
is the opposite of $\vc{a}$.  The vector $-\vc{a}$ is the vector 
with the same magnitude as $\vc{a}$ but that is pointed in the opposite direction.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "vector_opposite" %}</p>

<p>We define subtraction as addition with the opposite of a vector:
$$\vc{b}-\vc{a} = \vc{b} + (-\vc{a}).$$
This is equivalent to turning vector $\vc{a}$ around in the applying the
above rules for addition.  Can you see how the vector $\vc{x}$ in the
below figure is equal to $\vc{b}-\vc{a}$?  Notice how this is the same
as stating that $\vc{a}+\vc{x}=\vc{b}$, just like with subtraction of
scalar numbers.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "vector_b_minus_a" %}</p>


{% navigation_tag "scalarmultiplication" "Operations" "Scalar Multiplication" %}
<h4>Scalar multiplication</h4>

<p>Given a vector $\vc{a}$ and a real number ({%intlink scalar_definition %}scalar{%endintlink%}) $\lambda$, we can form the vector $\lambda\vc{a}$ as follows.
If $\lambda$ is positive, then $\lambda\vc{a}$ is the vector whose direction is the same as the direction of $\vc{a}$ and whose length is $\lambda$ times the length of $\vc{a}$.
In this case, multiplication by $\lambda$ simply stretches (if $\lambda>1$) or
compresses (if $0 < \lambda <1$) the vector $\vc{a}$.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, $\lambda$ is negative, then we have to take the 
opposite of $\vc{a}$ before stretching or compressing it.  In other words, 
the vector $\lambda\vc{a}$ points in the opposite direction of $\vc{a}$,
and the length of $\lambda\vc{a}$ is $|\lambda|$ times the length of $\vc{a}$.
No matter the sign of $\lambda$, we observe that the magnitude of $\lambda\vc{a}$ is $|\lambda|$ times the magnitude of $\vc{a}$: $\| \lambda \vc{a}\| = |\lambda| \|\vc{a}\|$.
</p>

<p>Scalar multiplications satisfies many of the same properties as 
the usual multiplication.</p>
<ol>
  <li>$s(\vc{a}+\vc{b}) = s\vc{a} + s\vc{b}$  (distributive law, form 1)</li>
  <li>$(s+t)\vc{a} = s\vc{a}+t\vc{a}$ (distributive law, form 2)</li>
  <li>$1\vc{a} = \vc{a}$</li>
  <li>$(-1)\vc{a} = -\vc{a}$</li>
  <li>$0\vc{a} = \vc{0}$</li>
</ol>

<p>In the last formula, the zero on the left is the number 0, while the
zero on the right is the vector $\vc{0}$, which is the unique vector whose length is zero.</p>

<p>If $\vc{a} = \lambda\vc{b}$ for some scalar $\lambda$, then we say
that the vectors $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$ are parallel.  If $\lambda$ is negative,
some people say that $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$ are anti-parallel, but we will
not use that language.</p>

<p>We were able to describe vectors, vector addition, vector subtraction, and
scalar multiplication without reference to any coordinate system.  
The advantage of such purely geometric reasoning is that our results hold generally, independent of any coordinate system in which the vectors live.
However, sometimes it is useful to express vectors in terms of coordinates,
as discussed in a page about  {% intlink vectors_cartesian_coordinates_2d_3d %}vectors in the standard Cartesian coordinate systems{%endintlink%} in the plane and in three-dimensional space.</p>
