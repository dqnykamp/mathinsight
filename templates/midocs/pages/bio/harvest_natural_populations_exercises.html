{% title "Harvest of natural populations exercises" %}
{% description "Exercises on optimizing the yield when harvesting a population." %}

<p>In the {% intlink "harvest_natural_populations" %}page on harvesting natural populations{%endintlink%}, we introduced the logstic equation with a harvesting rate of the form
\begin{align}
  P_{t+1}-P_{t} = r P_t\left(1-\frac{P_t}{M}\right) -h_t P_t,
  \label{harvest_fraction}
\end{align}
and analyzed a specific example with $r=0.2$.  In these exercises, you will analyze the general from with constant $h_t=h$ and $0 < r < 2$. </p>

{% counter exercisenum %}{% navigation_tag "exercise{{ exercisenum }}" "Exercises" "Exercise {{ exercisenum }}" %}
<h4>Exercise {{exercisenum}}</h4>

<p>Divide each term of equation \eqref{harvest_fraction} by $M$ to obtain
\begin{align}
p_{t+1} - p_t = r p_t  \left(1 - p_t \right) - h  p_t
  \label{harvest_fraction_normalized}
\end{align}
where $p_t = P_t/M$.</p>

<h4>Exercise {{exercisenum}}</h4>

<ol>
<li>Show that the equilibria of equation \eqref{harvest_fraction_normalized}
are $p_{e} = 0$ and $p_{e} = 1 - h/r$.</li>
<li>Show that in order for there to be a positive equilibrium,
the fractional harvest rate, $h$, must be less than the
low density growth rate, $r$.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Exercise {{exercisenum}}</h4>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Convert equation \eqref{harvest_fraction_normalized} (which is in difference form) to function iteration form $p_{t+1}=F(P_t)$.  Show that
\begin{align}
    p_{t+1} = F(p_t) = p_t + r  p_t  (1 - p_t) - h p_t.
    \label{harvest_fraction_iteration}
\end{align}
</li>
<li>Show that the equilibria of iteration \eqref{harvest_fraction_iteration}
are $p_{e} = 0$ and $p_{e} = 1 - h/r$. 
</li>
<li>
Assume that $h < r < 2$.  Compute $F'(p)$ and evaluate
$F'(0)$ and $F'(1-h/r)$.  Conclude that $0$
is an unstable equilibrium and $1-h/r$ is a stable equilibrium.
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Exercise {{exercisenum}}</h4>

<p>Assume that $h < r < 2$ so that $1-h/r$ is a positive, stable equilibrium of the iteration of equation \eqref{harvest_fraction_iteration}.</p>
The harvest at that equilibrium will be $h  (1 - h/r)$.
<ol>
  <li>Find the value of $h$ for which $h  (1-h/r)$ is the largest.
Conclude that in order to maximize harvest, the harvest fraction
$h$ should be set at one-half the low density growth rate, $r$.</li>
<li>Find the positive equilibrium $p_e$ for this value of $h$.</li>
<li>The variable $p_t$ was the actual population size $P_t$ normalized by the carrying capacity $p_t=P_t/M$.  What is the equilibrium value of the population size $P_t$ when the harvest rate is set at the value that maximizes harvest?  Your answer will be in terms of $M$.</li>
</ol>
