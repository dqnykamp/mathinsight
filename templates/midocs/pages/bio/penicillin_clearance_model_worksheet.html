  <li class="question medspacebelow"><p>Introduce appropriate notation for the penicillin dynamical system.  Think about what variable you should use for time.  Time in minutes or time measured in a different way?</p></li>
  <li class="question largespacebelow"><p>Write a discrete dynamical system model describing the change in penicillin concentration, based on the word model.  Your model should have an unknown parameter. Remember that since penicillin is removed at each time step, the change in penicillin concentration is negative.  </p></li>

  <li class="question extralargespacebelow"><p>Use the given data to determine the parameter in your dynamical system.  Don't determine separate values of the parameter for individual or pairs of data points.  Instead, fit your above model to  all the data at once.  Either include a printout of a graph used to determine the parameter or sketch what the graph looked like, with clearly labeled axes.  Clearly spell out your procedure for determining the parameter from the graph.</p></li>
    
  <li class="question medspacebelow"><p>For clarity, rewrite the final version of your dynamical system here, along with its initial condition.  Use the initial data point as the initial condition.</p></li>

  <li class="question largespacebelow"><p>Write a solution to your dynamical system model.  In your solution, remind us what the time variable is.</p></li>

  <li class="question medspacebelow"><p>Assuming that you used a different scale for time than minutes, rewrite your solution to give the penicillin concentration in terms of minutes after bolus injection.</p></li>

  <li class="question largespacebelow"><p> Compare the values computed from your solution with the observed data.  Display your results with a graph.</p></li>

 <li class="question medspacebelow"><p>We asserted that 20 percent of the penicillin leaves the blood every five minutes.  Did your analysis of the above data yield a result close to our assertion?</p></li>
