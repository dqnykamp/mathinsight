{% description "We give a word model for how penicillin should be cleared from the blood and allow you to construct a mathematical model to fit some data." %}


<p>In developing a {% intlink "bacteria_growth_initial_model" %}model of bacteria growth{%endintlink%}, we detailed every step of building the model from the data.  Since we assumed the change in the population size in one time step was a linear function of the population size, the model was so simple that we could even solve it.  We ended up with a fairly simple expression showing the {% intlink "exponential_growth_decay_discrete" %}exponential growth{%endintlink%} of the population size.</p>

<p>Here we'll examine a situation that seems completely different.  We'll look at what happens when we give a patient a {% extlink "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_%28medicine%29" %}bolus{%endextlink%} injection (a one-time injection) of penicillin.  In this case, of course, the penicillin won't start multiplying like bacteria in the patient.  Instead, the body (i.e., the kidneys) will start removing the penicillin from the body.  However, if we make a model where the amount of penicillin removed is a linear function of the amount penicillin in the blood, the model is starting to look a lot like the bacteria growth model.  In fact, we'll get {% intlink "exponential_growth_decay_discrete" %}exponential decay{%endintlink%} of the amount of penicillin in the blood.</p>

<p>There's one more big difference between the {% intlink "bacteria_growth_initial_model" %}bacteria growth example{%endintlink%} and this page.  Here, we'll just get you started on the process, and let you go make the model on your own.</p>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>When
penicillin was first discovered, its usefulness was limited by the
efficiency with which the kidney eliminates
penicillin from the blood plasma (blood minus blood cells) passing through it.    The modifications
that have been made to penicillin (leading to amphicillin, moxicillin,
mezlocillin, etc.)
have enhanced its ability to cross membranes
and reach targeted infections and reduced the rate at which
the kidney clears the plasma of penicillin.</p>

<p>Even with these improvements in penicillin, research suggests that the kidneys remove 20 percent of the penicillin in the plasma passing through them and that all of the blood plasma of a human passes through the kidneys in about 5 minutes.  You can check into the data leading to this conclusion.{% footnote "clearance_rate"  "That all of the plasma passes through the kidney in 5 minutes is taken from Rodney A. Rhoades and George A. Tanner, Medical Physiology, Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1995. &ldquo;In resting, healthy, young adult men, renal blood flow averages about 1.2 L/min&rdquo;, page 426, and &ldquo;The blood volume is normally 5-6 L in men and 4.5-5.5 L in women.&rdquo;, page 210. &ldquo;Hematocrit values of the blood of health adults are $47 \pm 5\%$ for men and $42 \pm 5\%$ for women&rdquo;, page 210 suggests that the amount of plasma in a male is about 6 L $\times$ 0.53 = 3.18 L.  Moreover, J. A. Webber and W. J. Wheeler, Antimicrobial and pharmacokinetic properties, in Chemistry and Biology of &beta;-Lactin Antibiotics, Vol. 1, Robert B. Morin and Marvin Gorman, Eds. Academic Press, New York, 1982, page 408 report plasma renal clearances of penicillin ranging from 79 to 273 ml/min. Plasma (blood minus blood cells) is approximately 53% of the blood so plasma flow through the kidney is about 6 liters $\times$ 0.53/5 min = 0.636 l/min. Clearance of 20% of the plasma yields plasma penicillin clearance of 0.636 = 0.2 = 0.127 l/min = 127 ml/min which is between 79 and 273 ml/min." %}</p>

<p>For this project, we are not going to trust the assertion that only 80% of the penicillin remains after five minutes.  Instead, we are going to look at data and build a mathematical model of the penicillin clearance.  (Afterward, we can see whether or not our model agrees with the above assertion.)  We will only accept the fact the rate that penicillin removed is proportional to the total amount of penicillin.  For the basis of our mathematical modeling, we formulate the following word model for the renal (i.e., kidney) clearance of penicillin.</p>

<section class="box info"> 
<h5>Renal clearance of penicillin</h5>
<p>
In each five minute interval following penicillin injection,
the kidneys remove a fixed fraction of the penicillin
that was in the plasma at the beginning of the five minute interval.</p>
</section>

<p>Your goal is to take this word model, translate it into a mathematical model, then use data to determine any free parameters of the model</p>

<p>The following table and graph contain data for serum penicillin concentrations at 5 minute intervals for the 20 minutes following a {% extlink "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolus_%28medicine%29" %}bolus{%endextlink%} injection (a one-time injection) of 2 g into the serum of &ldquo;five healthy young volunteers&rdquo; (read &ldquo;medical students&rdquo;) taken from T. Bergans, Penicillins, in <em>Antibiotics and Chemotherapy</em>, Vol 25, H. Schøonfeld, Ed., S. Karger, Basel, New York, 1978. We are interpreting serum in this case to be plasma.</p>

<h4>Your turn</h4>

<p>Now its your turn to develop a mathematical model of penicillin clearance.  You have the data along with assumption that the penicillin change each 5 minutes will depend linearly on the concentration.</p>

<p>Here are some steps to guide you.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Introduce appropriate notation.  Think about what variable you should use for time.  Time in minutes or time measured in a different way?</p></li>
  <li><p>Write a {% intlink "discrete_dynamical_system_introduction" %}discrete dynamical system model{%endintlink%} describing the change in penicillin concentration.  Compared to the {% intlink "bacteria_growth_initial_model" %}bacteria growth model{%endintlink%}, you will need a crucial negative sign here.  Penicillin is removed at each time step, so the change in penicillin concentration is negative.  </p>
    
    <p>The steps for the bacteria model will work well here.  You can use the 
{% intlink "population_change_versus_population_line" class="applet" %}linear model for population change applet{% endintlink %} even though we aren't talking about populations here.  At this level of description, your penicillin clearance model will have the same form as a population change model.  This applet will help you determine a crucial parameter of your model.  (It may be easier to use if you download the applet and {% extlink "http://geogebra.com" %}Geogebra{%endextlink%} on your computer, as described in the {% intlink "population_change_versus_population_line" class="applet" %}applet page{% endintlink %}.)</p>
  </li>
    
  <li><p>Write a solution to your dynamical system model.  If all goes well, your model should describe {% intlink "exponential_growth_decay_discrete" %}exponential decay{% endintlink%} in the penicillin concentration, so you know exactly the form your solution should take.  Assuming that you used a different scale for time than minutes, rewrite your solution to give the penicillin concentration in terms of minutes after bolus injection.</p></li>
  <li><p> Compare the values computed from your solution with the observed data.  One way to do this is download the {% intlink "function_iteration" class="applet" %}function iteration applet{% endintlink %} on your computer and run it in  {% extlink "http://geogebra.com" %}Geogebra{%endextlink%}.  (In this applet, you'll have to type in $x$ for the penicillin concentration variable in your dynamical system model.)  It's fairly simple to add points corresponding to the data into Geogebra.  Your should find that your model fits the data quite well.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We asserted that 20 percent of the penicillin leaves the blood every five minutes.  Did your analysis of the above data yield a result close to our assertion?</p>

<p>The procedure for fitting the model is formatted as a worksheet in the  {% intlink "penicillin_clearance_model_worksheet" %}penicillin clearance model worksheet{%endintlink%}.</p>
