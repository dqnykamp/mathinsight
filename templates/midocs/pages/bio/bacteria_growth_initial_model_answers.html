<h4>{% intlink bacteria_growth_initial_model thoughtexperiment normaltext %}Thought experiment initial question{%endintlink%}</h4>

<p><b>Question</b>: Suppose the time it takes for a cell to mature and divide is $\tau$ units of time.  What fraction of the cells should divide in each time step, where a time step is one unit of time?</p>

<p><b>Answer</b>: In $\tau$ time steps, every cell should divide once.  Therefore, in one time step, the fraction $1/\tau$ of the population should divide.  That way, in $\tau$ time steps, the fraction dividing would be $\tau \cdot 1/\tau = 1$.  This argument does not require that $\tau$ be an integer, so that if $\tau=5/2$, we'd expect $2/5$ of the population to divide in each time step.</p>

<h4>{% intlink bacteria_growth_initial_model thoughtexperiment2 normaltext %}Thought experiment followup question{%endintlink%}</h4>

<p><b>Question</b>: Suppose a plot of the change in bacteria density versus the density is well fit by a line through the origin at slope $2/3$. Estimate the time required for a cell to mature and divide.</p>


<p><b>Answer</b>: From {% intlink bacteria_growth_initial_model_answers thoughtexperiment1 %}above{%endintlink%}, we know that if the cells mature and divide every $\tau$ time steps, then the fraction $1/\tau$ of the population should divide every time step.  A slope of $2/3$ means that $2/3$ of the cells divide every time step.  Therefore, $2/3=1/\tau$, and the time for a cell to mature and divide is $\tau = 3/2$ time steps.</p>

<p>If each time step is 16 minutes, then the time for a cell to mature and divide is $16 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 24$ minutes.</p>

<p>In a plot of $B_{t+1}-B_t$ versus $B_t$, the first four points fall close to a line.  The slope of the line is approximately 0.7.  An approximate model is 
\[
B_{t+1} - B_t = 0.7 B_t
\]
</p>

<p>The means that approximately 70 percent of the cells divide in each
time interval, which is slightly more than we found for a pH of 6.25.  A solution to the dynamical system is
\[
B_t = B_0 \times 1.7^t = 0.028 \times 1.7^t.
\]
</p>

<p>The resulting values from the model are close to those of the data
except, perhaps, for the last value.</p>
