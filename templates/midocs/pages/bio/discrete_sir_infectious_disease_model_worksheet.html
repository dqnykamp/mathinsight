<h4>Initial exploration of model</h4>
<p>The discrete SIR infectious disease model has the state variables</p>
<ul>
  <li>$S_t$ = the number of susceptibles in day $t$</li>
  <li>$I_t$ = the number of infectives in day $t$</li>
  <li>$R_t$ = the number of removed in day $t$.</li>
</ul>
<p>and update rule
\begin{align*}
  S_{t+1} - S_t &= -b S_t I_t\\
  I_{t+1} - I_t &= b S_tI_t - aI_t\\
  R_{t+1} - R_t &= a I_t.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p class="question medspacebelow">Set the parameters to be $a=0.1$ and $b=0.00005$ and the initial conditions to $S_0=20,000$, $I_0=100$, and $R_0=0$.  How many people get sick in the first day?  How many people recover in the first day?  (Let's be cheerful and say that people in the removed class have recovered from the disease.)</p>

<p class="question medspacebelow">After the first day, how many people are susceptible ($S_1$) and how many are infective $(I_1$)?  How many have recovered from the disease ($R_1$)?</p>


<p class="question largespacebelow">Determine the values of the three state variables ($S_t$, $I_t$, and $R_t$) after 30 days and after 60 days.  What happens to the state variables as more time passes?  How do you interpret the results in terms of the outcome of the disease? Include a plot of $S_t$, $I_t$, and $R_t$ (a sketch is OK), and use the plot to explain your result.</p>

<p class="question medspacebelow">Keep $a=0.1$, fix the initial conditions as above,  and explore what happens as you change the value of $b$.  Find a value of $b$ where the long term results of the disease aren't so bad.  Explain why this occurred, both mathematically and in terms of how the disease works.</p>

<p class="question medspacebelow">Do you find any values of $b$ where the model doesn't make sense?  Explain what went wrong?</p>


<p class="question medspacebelow">Keep $b=0.00005$, fix the initial conditions as above, and explore what happens as you change the value of $a$.  How do you change $a$ to make the disease better or worse?  Explain your results.
</p>



<p class="question medspacebelow">What happens as you vaccinate more and more people, i.e., as you decrease $S_0$, keeping $I_0=100$ and $R_0=0$?  If you vaccinate enough people, is it possible to wipe out the disease before it gets all the remaining unvaccinated susceptibles sick?</p>

<p class="question medspacebelow">Without vaccinations and $S_0=20,000$, the disease only stopped when it ran out of susceptibles to infect.  If you can get the disease to stop even when there are still plenty of susceptibles around, what is happening to end the disease?  Is there hope to eradicate a disease without vaccinating every single individual?</p>


<h4 class="newpage">Mathematical analysis of model</h4>
<h5>Stopping the spread of the disease</h5>


<p class="question medspacebelow">Find an expression for the number of people that get sick in one day involving the state variables and parameters.  If the disease isn't spreading, then this expression must be zero.  Write out the condition for the disease to not be spreading.</p>

<p class="question medspacebelow">The no-spread condition should be an equation where the product of three factors is zero.  If the product of three factors is zero, what do you know about the three factors individually?  You should end up with three different conditions, each of which alone is sufficient for the disease to stop spreading.  Interpret each of these conditions in terms of the model and compare to the results you achieved in the first part.</p>


<h5>Outbreak or extinguish</h5>


<p class="question medspacebelow">In terms of the state variables and parameters, what is the expression that gives the net gain in the number of infectives over the course of a day?  Use this expression to write an inequality that is the condition for a decreasing number of infectives.  Explain how this decreasing infective condition is a weaker condition than the no-spread condition.</p>

<p class="question medspacebelow">The original condition you derived presumably involved two state variables.  Assuming that the no spread condition is not satisfied, can you eliminate one of the state variables?  The result should be an inequality involving both parameters as well as one state variable.</p>

<p class="question medspacebelow">When $S_0=20,000$, $a=0.1$, and $b=0.00005$, show that the decreasing infective condition is not satisfied.  If you keep $a$ and $b$ fixed at those values, what is the condition on the initial susceptible population size $S_0$ so that the decreasing infective condition is satisfied?  Verify with the SIR applet that the initial increase or decrease of the infective population size is predicted by this condition.</p>

<p class="question medspacebelow">Why does the decreasing infective condition not depend on the number of infectives $I_t$?</p>
