<h4>Background</h4>
{% boxedvideo "controlling_rabbit_population_introduction" %}


<p>Trouble is brewing on Foxless Island.  It appears that a family bought a couple of baby rabbits for their children, but then let them loose when their children ended up playing too rough with the bunnies. Unfortunately, without the presence of any predators on the island, the rabbit population is now exploding.  As head of the Foxless animal control team (FACT), you've been commissioned to develop and implement a plan to control the rabbit population.</p>

<p>It turns out many people, especially children, like having at least some rabbits around, so FACT has been asked to find a way to maintain a steady but small population of rabbits on Foxless Island.  You calculate that a population of about a thousand rabbits would allow occasional rabbit sightings while still minimizing the damage to gardens.  The trick is to develop a rabbit management plan that would ensure such a moderately sized population.</p>

{% navigation_tag "model" "Growth model" %}
<h4>The growth model</h4>

<p>A critical first step, you realize, is to develop a mathematical model of how the rabbit population is growing.  You employ a team of counters to sample the rabbit population each month in various locations across the island.  They report back that the rabbit population seems to be increasing by 20% each month.  Based on this information, you postulate the following {% intlink "discrete_dynamical_system_introduction" %}model{%endintlink%} for rabbit population growth.</p>

<p>You let the {% intlink "variable_definition" %}variable{%endintlink%} $p_t$ be the number of rabbits in month $t$.  The change in rabbit population from month $t$ to month $t+1$ is $p_{t+1}-p_t$, which you set equal to 20% of the population $p_t$ at the beginning of month:
\begin{gather}
  p_{t+1}-p_t = 0.2 p_t.
  \label{freemodelnoparameters}
\end{gather}
</p>

<p>After creating this model, you decide to replace the fixed fraction of 0.2 with a {% intlink "parameter_definition" %}parameter{%endintlink%} $r$ that you could change, to explore what would happen if the rabbit counters were a bit off in their estimate of the growth rate.  You end up with the model
\begin{gather}
   p_{t+1}-p_t = r p_t,
  \label{freemodel}
\end{gather}
where you tentatively set $r=0.2$.</p>

{% boxedvideo "controlling_rabbit_population_initial_plan" %}

<p>Model \eqref{freemodel} only gives the <em>change</em> in population size from month to month.  In order to use it to calculate any actual population sizes, you have to start it with an initial population size $p_0$ in some month which you'll denote as month 0.  Then the time index $t$ will measure months after that initial month.  You have no idea what to use for $p_0$, so decide to just explore what the model predicts for different values of $p_0$.</p>

{% navigation_tag "strategies" "Strategies" %}
<h4>Control strategies</h4>

<p>Leaving the rabbit population to grow rapidly according to equation \eqref{freemodel} is definitely not a viable option.   (Try the {% intlink "function_iteration" class="applet" %}function iteration applet{% endintlink %} with $f(x)=1.2x$ to see what happens when a value increases by 20% at each iteration.)  The island is beginning to be overrun by rabbits.  Despite the objections of the children, you will implement a control strategy that will involve trapping rabbits or hunting rabbits to reduce their numbers.  Your problem is to figure out how many rabbits you should remove each month in order to maintain a stable population of around a thousand rabbits.</p>

{% navigation_tag "fixednumber" "Strategies" "Fixed removal" %}
<h5>1. Removing a fixed number</h5>

<p>Your first idea is to remove a fixed number of rabbits each month.  This idea seems reasonable.  If you could find the right number so that the number of rabbits removed is equal to the number of rabbits produced in a given month, then it seems reasonable that the population should stabilize and you'd have the cure for the rabbit problem.</p>

<p>One difficulty is that you don't know how many rabbits you should remove each month.  However, you are resourceful and realize you can just let this number be the parameter $h$ (for &ldquo;harvest rate&rdquo;).  Then, you can vary the harvest rate $h$ until you get the mathematical model to do what you want.  Your revised model is
\begin{align}
   p_{t+1}-p_t &= r p_t-h.  \label{fixedremoval}\\
  \text{change} &= \text{reproduction} - \text{harvested}
  \notag
\end{align}
</p>

<p>Your task is to determine if this control strategy is a viable approach for maintaining a stable population of around a thousand rabbits. The first question is: can you find some combination of these three parameters that leads to a stable population size of around a thousand?</p>

<p>However, you must keep in mind that you can't determine the initial population size $p_0$ and reproduction rate $r$ exactly.  Since you can't be confident in the values of either of these parameters, your solution has to be able to handle uncertainty in these parameters.  Small changes in $p_0$ and $r$ shouldn't cause dramatic changes in the end result.  A solution can be acceptable only if the model maintains a stable population size even after small changes in $p_0$ and $r$ (while keeping the harvest rate $h$ fixed).</p>

<p>You can explore the behavior of this model with the following applet.</p>

{% boxedapplet "population_with_harvesting_fixed_number" %}

<p>Explain what you observe and why this occurs.  Do you notice any problem with this model?</p>

<p>The applet caption mentions an equilibrium $E=h/r$.  What does this equilibrium mean?  How does one get the expression $E=h/r$ from model \eqref{fixedremoval}?  What happens if you start with $p_0$ just above the equilibrium, right at the equilibrium, and just below the equilibrium?</p>


{% navigation_tag "proportional" "Strategies" "Proportional removal" %}
<h5>2. Removing a proportional number</h5>

<p>Your mathematical analysis has convinced you that model \eqref{fixedremoval} is not a viable strategy.  You hypothesize that the problem was the fact that the removal rate $h$ was constant independent of the population size $p_t$.  In order to fix the problem, you decide you should allow the removal rate to depend on the population size, replacing the fixed rate $h$ with a function $h(p_t)$ of the population size $p_t$.  Your new model is
\begin{gather}
   p_{t+1}-p_t = r p_t-h(p_t).
  \label{variableremoval}
\end{gather}
</p>

<p>The new model \eqref{variableremoval} is much more complicated than the original model \eqref{fixedremoval}.  Specifying a function $h(p_t)$ requires that you decide how the removal rate should adjust based on the population size.  You decide you should remove more rabbits when the population is high and fewer rabbits when the population is low.  The simplest form of $h(p_t)$ is to make it proportional to $p_t$ and let
\begin{gather}
h(p_t)=b p_t
  \label{proportionalremoval}
\end{gather}
where $b$ is the proportionality constant.</p>

<p>Use the below applet to explore the behavior of model \eqref{variableremoval} with proportional removal given by equation \eqref{proportionalremoval}.  To make $h(p_t)$ proportional to $p_t$, enter zero in the first box after &ldquo;$h(p_t)=$&rdquo; and enter a number for $b$ in the second box after &ldquo;$p_t \cdot$&rdquo;.  (Make sure the checkbox &ldquo;linear h&rdquo; is checked so that these two boxes are available.)</p>

<p>Don't worry about the fact that the model gives fractional rabbits.</p>

{% boxedapplet "population_with_variable_harvesting" %}

<p>Can you find a value of $b$ so that the model gives a stable population size of around a thousand rabbits?  If so, how does this choice depend on the initial population size $p_0$, and what would happen if you changed the reproduction rate a little bit while keeping your choice of $b$ fixed?</p>

{% navigation_tag "challenge" "Strategies" "A challenge" %}
<h5>3. A challenge</h5>

<p>You should have discovered that neither of the above two strategies gives a robust solution to the rabbit problem by keeping a stable population size of around a thousand rabbits.  If you found a solution that looked good, a small change in $r$ should have made the population either explode or crash to zero.  (At least for the second model with $h(p_t)=bp_t$, it crashed in a realistic way.)</p>

<p>Your challenge is to find a new form of the function $h(p_t)$ that works better.  As you might imagine, there is not a unique solution that will work; many different functions may work adequately.   If you like, you can use your own intuition and explore with the above applet to search for such a function.  To enter an arbitrary function $h(p_t)$, you can uncheck the &ldquo;linear h&rdquo; checkbox in the applet.  This will give you one large box in which to type your function $h(p_t)$.  You'll need to enter $p_t$ as p_t.</p>

<p>Here we'll give some hints to help you think through a way to build a function $h(p_t)$ that might do the job.</p>

<p>One possibility is that the proportional removal rate of equation \eqref{proportionalremoval} doesn't let the removal rate change enough with population size.  If one could make it grow faster when $p_t$ gets large, maybe it could keep the population from exploding.  If the removal rate could shrink faster when $p_t$ gets small, maybe it could keep the population from crashing to zero.</p>

<p>Can you think of a function $h(p_t)$ that could do this?  One way to think about it could be to make the proportionality constant $b$ in equation \eqref{proportionalremoval} adjust as a function of $p_t$ in order to accomplish your goal.</p>

<p>You may find when you enter new forms for $h(p_t)$ into the applet that the population immediately blows up or crashes to extremely large or small numbers.  If this happens, don't give up.  How can you tweak your function $h(p_t)$ so that it has less of a drastic effect?  By hand, you can calculate values of $h(p_t)$ for different values of $p_t$ to see if the values returned from $h(p_t)$ are reasonable.</p>

<p>If you find a function $h(p_t)$ that gives a stable population size of around a thousand rabbits, explain how you came up with that function.  For what ranges of $p_0$ and $r$ does it give reasonable values?  Explain why your function works.  Does it seem like a reasonable strategy to test out?  Is it perfect or does it have some flaws?  Do you feel confident enough to implement this strategy?</p>

<p>If you cannot find a function $h(p_t)$ that gives a stable population of around a thousand rabbits, explain what you tried and why your attempts didn't work.  Given that you couldn't get your model to give you a reasonable answer, what are you going to do about the rabbits?</p>
