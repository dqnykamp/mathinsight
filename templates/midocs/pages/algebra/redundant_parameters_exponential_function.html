{% description "Calculation showing that in the exponential function, changing either the base or a constant in the exponent have the same effect on the function." %}

<p>One way to add {% intlink "parameter_definition" %}parameters{% endintlink%} to the {% intlink "exponential_function" %}exponential function{% endintlink%} is to let the parameter $b$ be the base and the parameter $k$ multiply the exponent, forming the function
$$f(x)=b^{kx}.$$
Since the function $f$ has two parameters, $b$ and $k$, it can be represented by a {% intlink "function_machine" %}function machine{%endintlink%} with {% intlink "function_machine_parameters" %}two dials representing the parameters{%endintlink%}.</p>

<h4>Redundant</h4>

<p>But do these two dials do different things?  Does changing the $b$ dial really do something different than changing the $k$ dial?  Obviously, they show up in the function in different ways, so a given change to both parameters doesn't do exactly the same thing.  Doubling $b$ will have a different effect than doubling $k$.  But maybe a different change in $b$ will have the same effect as doubling $k$.</p>

<p>In fact, the two parameters $b$ and $k$ do have the same effect.  It turns out that you can square the value of $b$ to give the same effect as doubling the value of $k$. You can explore this fact with the following applet.  If you click the &ldquo;fix function&rdquo; checkbox, you can see how the effect of any change in one parameter can be undone by a corresponding change in the other parameter.</p>

{% boxedapplet "exponential_function" %}

<p>To see why this is true, we can do a simple calculation.  Understanding this calculation requires that you are comfortable with the basic rules of {% intlink "exponentiation_basic_rules" %}exponents{%endintlink%} and {% intlink "logarithm_basics" anchor="rules" %}logarithms{%endintlink%}.</p>

<p>In the original form of the function, $f(x)=b^{kx}$, it's hard to see any correspondence between $b$ and $k$ because they have very different relationships with the {% intlink "independent_variable_definition" %}independent variable{%endintlink%} $x$.  The parameter $k$ multiplies $x$, but the parameter $b$ is the base for the exponent involving $x$.  The first step in fixing this problem is to take the logarithm of both sides of the equation $f(x)=b^{kx}$:
$$\log f(x) = \log b^{kx}.$$
(For this calculation, it doesn't matter which base we use for the logarithm.)
</p>

<p>At first glance, this manipulation might not seem like an improvement.  But, the {% intlink "logarithm_basics" anchor="rules" %}properties of the logarithm{%endintlink%} allow us to make an important simplification.  We can take the exponent $kx$ down from $b$ and move it to multiply $\log b$.
\begin{align*}
  \log f(x) &= \log b^{kx}\\
  &=kx \log b\\
  &= x(k \log b)
\end{align*}
The final expression $x(k \log b)$ emphasizes that both $k$ and $\log b$ have the same relationship with the independent variable $x$. It's really not the separate values of $k$ and $b$ that matter in determining the function.  As long as I know the value of the combination $k \log b$, I don't care about the individual values of $k$ and $b$.  The combination is enough to determine $\log f(x)$, and hence the original function $f(x)$ itself.</p>

<p>When you check the &ldquo;fix function&rdquo; checkbox, the applet uses the expression $k \log b$ to calculate how to change one parameter to compensate for your change in the other. If you change $b$, it just finds the value of $k$ so that $k \log b$ is the same value as before you made the change.</p>

<p>For example, imagine you start with $k=2$ and $b=2$, which means $k \log b =2 \log 2$.  Now, you change change $k$ to $k=1$.  To keep the function fixed, we need to find the value of $b$ so that $1 \log b = 2 \log 2$.  Given the properties of the logarithm, we can write this condition as
$$\log b = 2\log 2 = \log 2^2.$$
In other words, we need $b=2^2=4$.</p>

<p>In general, if you cut $k$ in half, you need to square $b$ to cancel its effect.  Or, thinking of it another way, doubling $k$ is the same thing as squaring $b$.</p>

<p>We can conclude that we made our lives more complicated than we needed to by introducing both the parameter $b$ and the parameter $k$.  We can get rid of one of them without losing anything.  You might think the simplest thing to do would be to get rid of $k$ and write $f$ as
$$f(x) = b^x.$$
We do this sometimes.  But, for reasons that must remain mysterious until you've learned some calculus, we will commonly fix the exponential base to the irrational number
$$e= 2.718281828459045 \ldots .$$
Since we fix $b=e$, we need to keep the parameter $k$ to change the shape of the function $f$, writing $f$ in the form
$$f(x) = e^{kx}$$
with the single parameter $k$.  (The applet understands the value of $e$, so you can type $e$ in the box for $b$.)

<aside class="box info" >
<p><b>Food for thought:</b>  For what values of $k$ is $f(x)=e^{kx}$ increasing or decreasing?  For what values of $b$ is $f(x)=b^x$ increasing or decreasing?  If you put in both parameters $f(x)=b^{kx}$, for what combinations of $b$ and $k$ is the function increasing or decreasing?

<h4>Non-redundant</h4>

<p>We can add a second parameter to $f$ that is not redundant with $b$ or $k$.  Notice that for any value of $b$ or $k$, $f(0)=b^{k0}=1$.  To allow $f(0)$ to be a different value, we can introducing a scaling parameter $c$, defining
$$f(x)=c b^{kx}.$$
Then $f(0)=c$.  Since a change in $c$ cannot be reproduced by changing either $k$ or $b$, the parameter $c$ is not redundant and allows the function $f$ to have a different behavior.  You can add in the parameter $c$ by checking the &ldquo;allow scaling&rdquo; checkbox in the above applet.</p>

<p>If we fix $b=e$, then the function $$f(x)=ce^{kx}$$ has two parameters that do very different things.  The parameter $c$ scales the function and determines the value of $f(0)=c$.  The parameter $k$ determines how quickly the function increases or decreases.</p>
