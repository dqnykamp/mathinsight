<p>It is important to appreciate the behavior of exponential functions as
the input to them becomes a large positive number, or a large negative
number. This behavior is different from the behavior of polynomials or
rational functions, which behave similarly for large inputs regardless
of whether the input is large <i>positive</i> or large <i>negative</i>. By contrast, for exponential functions, the behavior is
radically different for large <i>positive</i> or large <i>negative</i>.</p>

<p>As a reminder and an explanation, let's remember that
exponential notation started out simply as an <b>abbreviation</b>: for
positive integer $n$,
$$2^n = 2 \times 2 \times 2\times \ldots \times 2\;\;\;\;\;\hbox{ ($n$
factors) }$$
$$10^n = 10 \times 10 \times 10\times \ldots \times 10\;\;\;\;\;\hbox{ ($n$
factors) }$$
$$\left({1\over 2}\right)^n = \left({1\over 2}\right) \times
\left({1\over 2}\right) \times \left({1\over 2}\right)\times \ldots
\times \left({1\over 2}\right) \;\;\;\;\;\hbox{ ($n$
factors) }$$</p>


<p>From this idea it's not hard to understand the <b>fundamental
properties of exponents</b> (they're not <i>laws</i> at all):
$$a^{m+n} = \underbrace{a\times a\times a\times \ldots \times a}_{m+n}\;\;\;\;\;\hbox{
($m+n$ factors)}$$
$$ = \underbrace{(a\times a\times a\times \ldots \times a)}_{m} \times 
\underbrace{(a\times a\times a\times \ldots \times a)}_{n}
 = a^m \times a^n$$
and also
$$a^{mn} = \underbrace{(a\times a\times a\times \ldots \times a)}_{mn}
= $$
$$ = \underbrace{
\underbrace{(a\times a\times a\times \ldots \times a)}_{m} \times
\ldots \times
\underbrace{(a\times a\times a\times \ldots \times a)}_{m}
}_n = (a^m)^n$$
at least for positive integers $m,n$. Even though we can only easily
see that these properties are true when the exponents are positive
integers, the <i>extended</i> notation is guaranteed (by its <i>meaning</i>, not by <i>law</i>) to follow the same rules.</p>

<p>Use of <i>other</i> numbers in the exponent is something that
came later, and is also just an <i>abbreviation</i>, which happily
was <i>arranged</i> to match the more intuitive simpler version. For
example,
$$a^{-1} = {1\over a}$$
and (as consequences)
$$a^{-n} = a^{n\times(-1)} = (a^n)^{-1} = {1\over a^n}$$
(whether $n$ is positive or not). Just to check one example of
consistency with the properties above, notice that
$$a = a^1 = a^{(-1)\times (-1)} = {1\over a^{-1}} = {1\over 1/a} = a$$
This is not supposed to be surprising, but rather reassuring that we
won't reach false conclusions by such manipulations.</p>

<p>Also, fractional exponents fit into this scheme. For example
$$a^{1/2} = \sqrt{a}\;\;\;\;\;a^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]{a}$$
$$a^{1/4} = \sqrt[4]{a}\;\;\;\;\;a^{1/5} = \sqrt[5]{a}$$
This is <i>consistent</i> with earlier notation: the fundamental
property of the $n^{\rm th}$ root of a number is that its $n^{\rm th}$
power is the original number. We can check:
$$a = a^1 = (a^{1/n})^n = a$$
Again, this is not supposed to be a surprise, but rather a consistency
check.</p>

<p>Then for arbitrary <i>rational</i> exponents $m/n$ we can
maintain the same properties: first, the definition is just
$$a^{m/n} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m$$</p>

<p>One hazard is that, if we want to have only real numbers (as
opposed to complex numbers) come up, then we should not try to take
square roots, $4^{\rm th}$ roots, $6^{\rm th}$ roots, or any <i>even</i> order root of negative numbers.</p>

<p>For general <i>real</i> exponents $x$ we likewise should <i>not</i> try
to understand $a^x$ except for $a>0$ or we'll have to use complex
numbers (which wouldn't be so terrible). But the value of $a^x$ can
only be defined as a <i>limit</i>: let $r_1,r_2,\ldots$ be a sequence
of <i>rational</i> numbers approaching $x$, and define
$$a^x = \lim_i \;a^{r_i}$$
We would have to check that this definition does not accidentally
depend upon the sequence approaching $x$ (it doesn't), and that the same properties
still work (they do).</p>

<p>The number $e$ is not something that would come up in really
elementary mathematics, because its reason for existence is not really
elementary. Anyway, it's approximately
$$e = 2.71828182845905$$
but if this ever really mattered you'd have a calculator at your side,
hopefully.</p>

<p>With the definitions in mind it is easier to make sense of
questions about <b>limits</b> of exponential functions. The two
companion issues are to evaluate
$$\lim_{x\rightarrow +\infty}\;a^x$$
$$\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}\;a^x$$
Since we are allowing the exponent $x$ to be <i>real</i>, we'd better
demand that $a$ be a <i>positive real</i> number (if we want to avoid
complex numbers, anyway). Then
$$\lim_{x\rightarrow +\infty}\;a^x = 
\left\{\matrix{
+\infty&amp; \hbox{ if } &amp; a>1 \cr 
1&amp; \hbox{ if } &amp; a=1 \cr 
0&amp; \hbox{ if } &amp; 0< a<1
}\right.$$
$$\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}\;a^x = 
\left\{\matrix{
0&amp; \hbox{ if } &amp; a>1 \cr 
1&amp; \hbox{ if } &amp; a=1 \cr 
+\infty&amp; \hbox{ if } &amp; 0< a<1
}\right.$$</p>

<p>To remember which is which, it is sufficient to use $2$ for
$a>1$ and ${1\over 2}$ for $0< a<1$, and just let $x$ run 
through positive integers as it goes to $+\infty$. Likewise, it is
sufficient to use $2$ for $a>1$ and ${1\over 2}$ for $0< a<1$,
and just let $x$ run through negative integers as it goes to
$-\infty$.</p>
