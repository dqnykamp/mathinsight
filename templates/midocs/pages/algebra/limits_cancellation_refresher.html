{% title "Limits with cancellation" %}
{% description "Calculating limits of a fraction my canceling factors from the numerator and denominator." %}


<p>In simple cases, {% intlink "elementary_limits_refresher" %}one can calculate a limit{%endintlink%} by just pluggin in the limit value. 
But sometimes things &lsquo;blow up&rsquo; when the limit number is substituted:
$$\lim_{x\rightarrow 3} {x^2-9\over x-3}={0\over 0}\;\;?????$$
Ick. This is not good. However, in this example, as in <i>many</i>
examples, doing a bit of simplifying algebra first gets rid of the
factors in the numerator and denominator which cause them to vanish:
$$\lim_{x\rightarrow 3} {x^2-9\over x-3}=
\lim_{x\rightarrow 3} {(x-3)(x+3)\over x-3}=
\lim_{x\rightarrow 3} {(x+3)\over 1}={(3+3)\over 1}=6$$
Here at the very end we <i>did</i> just plug in, after all.</p>

<p>The lesson here is that some of those darn algebra tricks
(&lsquo;identities&rsquo;) are helpful, after all. If you have a &lsquo;bad&rsquo; limit, <i>always</i> look for some <i>cancellation</i> of factors in the numerator
and denominator. </p>

<p>In fact, for hundreds of years people <i>only</i> evaluated limits
in this style! After all, human beings can't really execute infinite
limiting processes, and so on.</p>
