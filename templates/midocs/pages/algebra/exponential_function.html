<h4>Overview of the exponential function</h4>

<p>The exponential function is one of the most important {% intlink function_definition%}functions{%endintlink%} in mathematics (though it would have to admit that the {%intlink linear_function_one_variable %}linear function{%endintlink%} ranks even higher in importance). To form an exponential function, we let the {% intlink independent_variable_definition %}independent variable{%endintlink%} be the {% intlink exponentiation_basic_rules%}exponent{%endintlink%}.  A simple example is the function
$$f(x)=2^x.$$</p>

{% image exponential_function_two_to_x %}

<p>As illustrated in the above graph of $f$, the exponential function increases rapidly.  Exponential functions are solutions to the simplest types of {% intlink dynamical_system_idea %}dynamical systems{%endintlink%}.  For example, an exponential function arises in {% intlink bacteria_growth_initial_model %}simple models of bacteria growth{%endintlink%}</p>

<p>An exponential function can describe {% intlink exponential_growth_decay_discrete %}growth or decay{%endintlink%}.  The function
$$g(x)=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^x$$
is an example of exponential decay.  It gets rapidly smaller as $x$ increases, as illustrated by its graph.</p>

{% image exponential_function_half_to_x %}

<p>In the exponential growth of $f(x)$, the function doubles every time you add one to its input $x$.  In the exponential decay of $g(x)$, the function shrinks in half every time you add one to its input $x$.  The presence of this {% intlink doubling_time_half_life_discrete%}doubling time or half-life{%endintlink%} is characteristic of exponential functions, indicating how fast they grow or decay.</p>

<h4>Parameters of the exponential function</h4>

<p>As with any function, the action of an exponential function $f(x)$ can be captured by the {% intlink function_machine %}function machine metaphor{%endintlink%} that takes inputs $x$ and transforms them into the outputs $f(x)$.</p>

{% image function_machine 300 %}

<p>The function machine metaphor is useful for introducing {% intlink parameter_definition %}parameters{%endintlink%} into a function.  The above exponential functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are two different functions, but they differ only by the change in the {% intlink exponentiation_basic_rules %}base of the exponentiation{%endintlink%} from 2 to 1/2. We could capture both functions using a single function machine but {% intlink function_machine_parameters %}dials to represent parameters{%endintlink%} influencing how the machine works.</p>

{% image function_machine_parameters %}

<p>We could represent the base of the exponentiation by a parameter $b$.  Then, we could write $f$ as a function with a single parameter (a function machine with a single dial):
$$f(x)=b^{x}.$$
When $b=2$, we have our original exponential growth function $f(x)$, and when $b=\frac{1}{2}$, this same $f$ turns into our original exponential decay function $g(x)$.  We could think of a function with a parameter as representing a whole family of functions, with one function for each value of the parameter.</p>

<p>We can also change the exponential function by including a constant in the exponent.  For example, the function 
$$h(x)=2^{3x}$$
is also an exponential function.  It just grows faster than $f(x)=2^x$ since $h(x)$ doubles every time you add only $1/3$ to its input $x$.  We can introduce another parameter $k$ into the definition of the exponential function, giving us two dials to play with.  If we call this parameter $k$, we can write our exponential function $f$ as
$$f(x)=b^{kx}.$$
You can explore the influence of both parameters $b$ and $k$ in the following applet.</p>

{% boxedapplet "exponential_function" %}

<p>It turns out that adding both parameters $b$ and $k$ to our definition of $f$ is really unnecessary.  We can still get the full range of functions if we eliminate either $b$ or $k$.  You can see this fact through the above applet.  For example, you can see that the function $f(x)=3^{2x}$ ($k=2$, $b=3$) is exactly the same as the function $f(x)=9^x$ ($k=1$, $b=9$).  In fact, for any change you make to $k$, you can make a compensating change in $b$ to keep the function the same.  To see this, check the &ldquo;fix function&rdquo; checkbox.  Then, if you change either $b$ or $k$, the applet will automatically make a compensatory change in the other parameter to keep the function the same.  If you are curious why this is true, you can check out the {% intlink redundant_parameters_exponential_function %}calculation showing the two parameters are redundant{%endintlink%}.</p>

<p>Since it is silly to have both parameters $b$ and $k$, we will typically eliminate one of them.  The easiest thing to do is eliminate $k$ and go back to the function
$$f(x)=b^x.$$
We will use this function a bit at first, changing the base $b$ to make the function grow or decay faster or slower.</p>

<p>However, once you start learning some calculus, you'll see that it is more natural to get rid of the base parameter $b$ and instead use the constant $k$ to make the function grow or decay faster or slower.  Except, we can't exactly get rid of the base $b$.  If we set $b=1$, we'd have the boring function $f(x)=1$, or, if we set $b=0$, we'd have the even more boring function $f(x)=0$.  We need to choose some other value of $b$.</p>

<p>If we didn't have calculus, we'd probably choose $b=2$, writing our exponential function as $f(x)=2^{kx}$.  Or, since we like the decimal system so well, maybe we'd choose $b=10$ and write our exponential function of $f(x)=10^{kx}$.  According to the above discussion, it shouldn't matter whether we use $b=2$ or $b=10$, as we can get the same functions either way (just with different values of $k$).</p>

<a id="exponent_base_e" class="anchor"></a>
<p>But, it turns out that calculus tells us there is a natural choice for the base $b$.  Once you learn some calculus, {% intlink exploring_derivative_exponential_function %}you'll see why{% endintlink%} the most common base $b$ throughout the sciences is the irrational number
$$e= 2.718281828459045 \ldots .$$
Fixing $b=e$, we can write the exponential functions as
$$f(x) = e^{kx}.$$
(The applet understands the value of $e$, so you can type $e$ in the box for $b$.)  Using $e$ for the base is so common, that $e^x$ (&ldquo;e to the $x$&rdquo;) is often referred to simply as <em>the exponential function</em>.
</p>

<p>To increase the possibilities for the exponential function, we can add one more parameter $c$ that scales the function:
$$f(x)=c b^{kx}.$$
Since $f(0)=cb^{k0} = c$, we can see that the parameter $c$ does something completely different than the parameters $b$ and $k$.  We'll often use two parameters for the exponential function: $c$ and one of $b$ or $k$.  For example, we might set $k=1$ and use
$$f(x)=cb^x$$
or set $b=e$ and use
$$f(x)=ce^{kx}.$$
You can add the parameter $c$ to the applet by checking the &ldquo;scale function&rdquo; checkbox.</p>
