<p>A <b>{% intlink function_definition %}function{%endintlink%}</b> $f$ is a <i>procedure</i> or <i>process</i> which
converts <i>input</i> to <i>output</i> in some way. A traditional
mathematics name for the input is <i>argument</i>, but this certainly
is confusing when compared with ordinary English usage.</p>

<p>The collection of all &lsquo;legal&rsquo; &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; or &lsquo;sensible&rsquo; inputs is
called the <b>{% intlink domain_definition %}domain{%endintlink%}</b> of the function. The collection of all
possible outputs is the <b>{% intlink range_definition%}range{%endintlink%}</b>. (Contrary to the impression some
books might give, it can be very difficult to figure out all possible
outputs!)</p>

<p>The question &lsquo;What's the domain of this function?&rsquo; is usually not what
it appears to be. For one thing, if we are being formal, then
a function hasn't even been <i>described</i> if its <i>domain</i>
hasn't been described!</p>

<p>What is really meant, usually, is something far less
mysterious. The question usually <i>really</i> is <b>&lsquo;What numbers
can be used as inputs to this function without anything bad
happening?&rsquo;</b>.</p>

<p class="pre_list">For our purposes, &lsquo;something bad happening&rsquo; just refers to one of</p>
<ul>
<li>trying to take the square root of a negative number,</li>
<li>trying to take a logarithm of a negative number,</li>
<li>trying to divide by zero, or</li>
<li>trying to find <i>arc-cosine</i> or <i>arc-sine</i> of a number
bigger than $1$ or less than $-1$.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, dividing by zero is the worst of these, but as
long as we insist that everything be <i>real</i> numbers (rather than
<i>complex</i> numbers) we can't do the other things either.</p>

<p>For example, what is the domain of the function
$$f(x)= \sqrt{x^2-1} \hbox {?}$$
Well, what could go wrong here? No division is indicated at all, so
there is no risk of dividing by $0$. But we are taking a square root,
so we must insist that $x^2-1\ge 0$ to avoid having complex numbers
come up. That is, a preliminary description of the &lsquo;domain&rsquo; of this
function is that it is the set of real numbers $x$ so that $x^2-1\ge
0$. </p>

<p>But we can be clearer than this: we know how to solve such
inequalities. Often it's simplest to see what to <i>exclude</i> rather
than <i>include</i>: here we want to <i>exclude</i> from the domain any
numbers $x$ so that $x^2-1<0$ from the domain.</p>

<p>We recognize that we can factor 
$$x^2-1=(x-1)(x+1)=(x-1)\;(x-(-1)).$$
This is negative exactly on the interval $(-1,1)$, so this is the
interval we must prohibit in order to have just the domain of the
function. That is, the domain is the union of two intervals:
$$(-\infty,-1] \cup [1,+\infty)$$</p>
