{% title "Elementary limits" %}
{% description "The simplest way to find a limit that works in the easiest cases." %}

<p>The idea of <b>limit</b> is intended to be merely a slight extension of
our <i>intuition</i>. The so-called $\varepsilon,\delta$-definition was
invented after people had been doing calculus for hundreds of years,
in response to certain relatively pathological technical
difficulties. For quite a while, we will be entirely concerned with
situations in which we can either &lsquo;directly&rsquo; see the value of a limit
<i>by plugging the limit value in</i>, or where we <i>transform</i> the
expression into one where we <i>can</i> just plug in.</p>

<p>So long as we are dealing with functions no more complicated
than polynomials, most <i>limits</i> are easy to understand: for
example,
$$\lim_{x\rightarrow 3} 4x^2+3x-7= 4\cdot (3)^2+3\cdot(3)-7=38$$
$$\lim_{x\rightarrow 3} {4x^2+3x-7\over 2-x^2}= 
{4\cdot (3)^2+3\cdot(3)-7\over 2-(3)^2}={38\over -7}$$.</p>

<p>The point is that we just substituted the &lsquo;$3$&rsquo; in and <i>nothing
bad happened</i>. This is the way people evaluated easy limits for
hundreds of years, and should always be the first thing a person does,
just to see what happens. </p>
