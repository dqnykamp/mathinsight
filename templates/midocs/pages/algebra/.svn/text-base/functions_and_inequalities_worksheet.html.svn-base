<p class="question smallspacebelow">If you allow people to harvest (i.e., catch) a fraction $p$ of the
fish in a certain lake each year, then the number of fish in the lake
will eventually drop to $1000(1-10p)$.  Without worrying about
fractional fish, for what range of values of $p$ could this possibly
be a reasonable result?  Express your answer as an inequality
involving $p$.</p>


<p class="question smallspacebelow">Let $P=100 p$.  What range of $P$ does your above answer correspond
to?</p>

<p class="question smallspacebelow">Let $s=\beta p$, where $\beta$ (greek letter &ldquo;beta&rdquo;) is some fixed
number (a parameter).  What range of $s$ does your above answer
correspond to?</p>

<p class="question smallspacebelow">Let $M$ be a positive number (a parameter).  If you allow people to
harvest (i.e., catch) a fraction $q$ of the fish in a certain lake
each year, then the number of fish in the lake will eventually drop to
$M(1-10q)$.  Without worrying about fractional fish, for what range
of values of $q$ could this possibly be a reasonable result?  Express
your answer as an inequality involving $q$.</p>

<p class="question smallspacebelow">Let $k$ and $a$ be positive numbers (parameters).  If you allow people to
harvest (i.e., catch) a fraction $v$ of the fish in a certain lake
each year, then the number of fish in the lake will eventually drop to
$k(1-av)$.  Without worrying about fractional fish, for what range
of values of $v$ could this possibly be a reasonable result?  Express
your answer as an inequality involving $v$.</p>
