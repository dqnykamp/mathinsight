<h4>Overview of autonomous differential equation</h4>

<p>An autonomous differential equation is an equation of the form 
\begin{align*}
  \diff{y}{t} = f(y).
\end{align*}
Let's think of $t$ as indicating time. This equation says that the
rate of change $dy/dt$ of the function $y(t)$ is given by a some rule.
The rule says that if the current value is $y$, then the rate of
change is $f(y)$.</p>

<p>The equation is called a differential equation, because it is an
equation involving the derivative $dy/dt$.  The differential equation
is called autonomous because the rule doesn't care what time $t$ it
is.  It only cares about the current value of the variable $y$.</p>

<p>Given an autonomous differential equation, we'll often want to solve
the equation, which means find a function a $y(t)$ whose derivative
$dy/dt$ is equal to $f(y)$.</p>

<h4>A linear differential equation</h4>

<p>An example of an autonomous differential equation, let's let $f(y)$ be
the linear function $f(y)=2y$, so the equation is
\begin{align*}
  \diff{y}{t} = 2y.
\end{align*}
which we could also write as
 \begin{align*}
  \diff{y}{t}(t) = 2y(t),
\end{align*}
but, usually, we won't write out the explicit dependence on $t$.</p>

<p>We've ended up with a linear differential equation, one of the
simplest types.</p>

{% navigation_tag "linear" "Linear" "Solution methods" %}
<h5>Solution methods</h5>

<p>How can we solve this equation, i.e., find a function $y(t)$ that, if we
differentiate, we get the function $y(t)$ back, only multiplied by
two?  We have three main methods for solving autonomous differential
equations.</p>

<ol><li><b>Numerical methods.</b> We can approximate the continuous change of the
differential equation with discrete jumps in time,  By doing this, we
get a formula for evolving from one time step to the next (like a a discrete
dynamical system).  We can then use a computer to calculate this
approximation to the solution.</li>

<li><b>Graphical methods.</b>  We can use a plot of the graph of $f(y)$ to
determine the behavior of $y(t)$.</li>

<li><b>Analytic methods.</b>  We can use mathematics to find a function $y(t)$
that satisfies the differential equation.</li>
</ol>

{% navigation_tag "linear" "Linear" "Guess and Check method" %}
<h5>The Guess and Check method</h5>

<p>Here, let's try an analytic method.  We'll use an important analytic
method, which is called <em>guess and check</em>.  Guess and check is a
perfectly valid method because, if you can find any function that
satisfies the equation, you've found a solution.  It doesn't matter
what method you use to find the function; as long as you can show it
is a solution, you've accomplished the task.</p>

<p>The way to guess is to use your knowledge and intuition above
derivatives to find a function whose derivative behaves in the
required way.</p>

<p>Here we want to find a function where, if we take the derivative, we
get the function back, only multiplied by 2.  Let's forget about the
factor of two for a moment.  Do you know any function that is it's own
derivative?  </p>

<p>The exponential function fits the bill.  Remember that
\begin{align*}
  \diff{}{t} e^t = e^t.
\end{align*}
so if $y(t)=e^t$, then $\diff{y}{t} = e^t = y(t)$.  </p>

<p>That's pretty close to the right behavior.  We just want the
derivative to bring down a factor of two.  Remember the chain
rule and how the chain rule says that the derivative of $f(g(t))$
gives the derivative of $f$ multiplied by the derivative of $g$.  If
we make $g(t)=2t$, then its derivative is 2, so we multiply by 2.  In
fact, if
\begin{align*}
  y(t) = e^{2t}
\end{align*}
then 
\begin{align*}
  \diff{y}{t} = 2e^{2t} = 2y(t).
\end{align*}
That's exactly what we are looking for.  The function $y(t)=e^{2t}$
solves the differential equation
\begin{align*}
  \diff{y}{t} = 2y.
\end{align*}
Our guess and check method found the solution.</p>

{% navigation_tag "linear" "Linear" "The general solution" %}
<h5>The general solution</h5>

<p>We found a solution OK, but is $y(t)=e^{2t}$ the only solution?  Is
there any other function whose derivative is twice the function?</p>

<p>What if we multiplied $y(t)$ by 3?  We know that if we multiply a
function by a constant number, that number just comes out of the
derivative.  Let's try the function
\begin{align*}
  y(t) = 3e^{2t}.
\end{align*}
With that $y(t)$,
\begin{align*}
  \diff{y}{t} = 6 e^{2t} = 2(3 e^{2t}) = 2y(t).
\end{align*}
So the function $y(t)=3e^{2t}$ works.  In fact so does $5e^{2t}$, $2.3
e^{2t}$ or $Ce^{2t}$ for any number $C$.  In general any function of
the form
\begin{align*}
  y(t) = Ce^{2t}
\end{align*}
will satisfy the differential equation $\diff{y}{t} = 2y$.  The
constant number $C$ just comes out of the derivative.  It turns out
that all solutions are of this form.  We call $y(t)$,
the <em>general solution</em> to the differential equation.</p>
