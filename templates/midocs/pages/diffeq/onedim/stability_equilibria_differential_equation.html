<h4>Stability theorem</h4>

<p>Let $\diff{x}{t} = f(x)$ be an autonomous differential equation.  Suppose $x(t)=x^*$ is an equilibrium, i.e.,
$f(x^*)=0$.  Then
<ul>
<li>if $f'(x*)<0$, the equilibrium $x(t)=x^*$ is stable, and</li>
<li>if $f'(x^*)>0$, the equilibrium $x(t)=x^*$ is unstable.</li>
</ul>
