{% title "The influence of network structure on correlations" %}
{% description "If a network is operating in a linear regime, one can piece together the influence of network motifs on correlations." %}

<p>Pernice et al. have developed an approach to analyze the influence of different network motifs on correlations between the activity of a pair of nodes.{% citation pernice_et_al_pcb_2011 %}</p>

{% image connectivity_induces_correlations_pernice_et_al_2011 %}

<p>To get the flavor of their approach, let's imagine a very simplified model, where the $N$-dimensional $\vc{x}$ is the activity of the $N$ network nodes.  Image that, if the network were uncoupled the activity of the nodes would be $\vc{x}_0$.  With the coupling, the activity $\vc{x}$ satisfies this simple linear self-consistency equation
$$\vc{x} = \vc{x}_0 + wA\vc{x},$$
where $A$ is the {% intlink network_introduction adjacency_matrix %}adjancency matrix{%endintlink%} and the scalar $w$ is the weighting of the effect of each connection.</p>

<p>We can easily solve this equation for $\vc{x}$ in terms of the uncoupled activity $\vc{x}_0$.
$$\vc{x} = (I-wA)^{-1}\vc{x}_0$$</p>

<p>For simplicity, assume that the $\vc{x}$ are all mean zero.  We can calculate their correlation as $E(\vc{x}\vc{x}^T)$, where $E(\cdot)$ is the expected value from measuring the activity over many experiments.</p>

<p>The correlation satisfies
$$E(\vc{x}\vc{x}^T) = (I-wA)^{-1}E(\vc{x}_0\vc{x}_0^T)(I-wA^T)^{-1}$$
which we can rewrite as
$$C= (I-wA)^{-1}C_0(I-wA^T)^{-1}$$
</p>

<p>$C_0$ the correlation if there were no coupling.  Since the nodes would be independent in this case, it is a diagonal matrix.  Let's assume that the network is statistically homogeneous so that all diagonal entries of $C_0$ are the same, equal to the constant $c_0$: $C_0 = c_0 I$.  Then we can rewrite our equation as   
$$\frac{C}{c_0}= (I-wA)^{-1}(I-wA^T)^{-1}.$$
</p>

<p>If we assume weak coupling so that  $wA$ is small, then we can expand in a power series.
$$\frac{C}{c_0} = \sum_{i,j=0}^\infty w^{i+j} A^i(A^T)^i.$$
</p>

<p>Each term $A^i(A^T)^i$ represents different network motifs.  For example $AA^T$ represents divergence motif, and $A^2$ or $(A^T)^2$ represent chains of two edges.  In this way, you can examine how different motifs influence the correlations.</p>

<p>For example, if you consider just motifs of two edges, then you find that just the divergent motif and the chain motif influence correlations.</p>
