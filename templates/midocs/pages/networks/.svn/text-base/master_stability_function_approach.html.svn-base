{% title "The master stability function approach to determine the synchronizability of a network" %}
{% description "The master stability function approach allows one to analyze how network structure influences the stability of the completely synchronous state.." %}

<p>The master stability function of Pecora and Carroll{% citation pecora_carroll_prl_1998 %} allows one to study the stability of the synchronous state for a large class of oscillator models coupled through a complex network.</p>

<p>The underlying model must be of the form
  \begin{align*}
    \diff{\vc{x}_i}{t} = \vc{F}(\vc{x}_i) +  S \sum_{j \ne i} A_{ij}
    (\vc{H}(\vc{x}_j) - \vc{H}(\vc{x}_i))
  \end{align*}
  $\vc{F}$: internal dynamics function.  $\vc{H}$: coupling function.
  $S$: coupling strength.   $A$: network {% intlink network_introduction adjacency_matrix %}adjacency matrix{%endintlink%}.</p>
  
<p>Due to the form of coupling, one solution is alwasy the synchronous state $\vc{x}_i(t) = \tilde{\vc{x}}(t)$, where all nodes $i$ are equal to the solution $\tilde{\vc{x}}(t)$ of the uncoupled equation.</p>

<p>Define the network Laplacian as $L=D-A$, where $D$ is diagonal of row sums of $A$.  Rewrite model as:
  \begin{align*}
    \diff{\vc{x}_i}{t} = \vc{F}(\vc{x}_i) - S \sum_{j\ne i} L_{ij} \vc{H}(\vc{x}_j)
  \end{align*}
</p>

<p>Linearize around synchronous state $\vc{x}_i=\tilde{\vc{x}}$.
  \begin{align*}
    \delta \vc{x}_i = \vc{x}_i - \tilde{\vc{x}}
  \end{align*}
  Assume can diagonalize $L$.  Can decompose into separate equations
  along eigenvectors of $L$.
  \begin{align*}
    \textstyle \diff{\vc{y}_i}{t} = \left[D_{\vc{F}}(\tilde{\vc{x}}) - S\mu_i
    D_{\vc{H}}(\tilde{\vc{x}})\right] \vc{y}_i
  \end{align*}
  where $\vc{y}_i$ is mode of $\delta \vc{x}$ corresponding to $i$th
  eigenvector.</p>

<p>Calculate Lyapunov exponents of system.  Need all to be negative to
  be stable.  Find a region in complex plane in which all
  $S\mu_i$ must lie for stability.</p>

<p>Conclusion from Master Stability Function analysis:
The effect of the network and the dynamics are separate.  The dynamics $F$ and $H$ determine the region a critical region in the complex plane.  In order for the completely synchronous state of a network to be stable, all scaled eigenvalues $S\mu_i$ must fit into the region.</p>

<p>If we are studying a network without knowing anything about the dynamics, we can still conclude that the more spread out the eigenvalues of $L=D-A$, the more likely the synchronous state will be unstable.  We can use the spread of Laplacian eigenvalues as a {% intlink connecting_network_structure_dynamics synchronizability_index %}synchronizability index{% endintlink%}.</p>

<p>For {% intlink undirected_graph_definition%}undirected graphs{%endintlink%}, the adjacency matrix $A$, and hence the Laplacian $L$, is symmetric.  The eigenvalue are real.  As one eigenvalue of the $L$ is always zero, so a measure for the spread of eigenvalues is the ratio of the largest to the smallest, $\mu_N/\mu_2$.</p>

<p>For {% intlink directed_graph_definition%}directed networks{%endintlink%}, 
Nishikawa and Motter{% citation nishikawa_motter_pnas_2010 %} proposed using the normalized standard deviation of the eigenvalues as a synchronizability index.

\begin{align}
  \sigma_\mu^2 = \frac{1}{d^2(N-1)}\sum_{i=2}^N | \mu_i -
  \bar{\mu}|^2,
  \label{eq:var_mu}
\end{align}
where $\bar{\mu} = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=2}^N \mu_i$ is the mean of
the eigenvalues, $N$ is the number of nodes, and $d$ is the mean degree.
This variance ignores the zero eigenvalue $\mu_1=0$ present in
every Laplacian matrix. </p>

  
  {% comment %}
  Cool fact: eigenvalues of $L$ are nearly the entries of $D$.

  Obvious fact: entries of $D$ are the incoming   degrees

  Conclusion: the larger spread of incoming degrees, the more likely the
  synchronous state will be unstable
