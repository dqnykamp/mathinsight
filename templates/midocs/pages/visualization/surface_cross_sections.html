{% title "Cross sections of a surface" %}
{% description "A sketch of how to determine the cross sections of surfaces and use them to understand the shape of a surface." %}

<p>In general, the graph of an equation involving three variables is a surface
that is floating in three dimensions.  If one can write the equation
in the form $z=f(x,y)$, then the surface is the
{% intlink surface_graph_function%}graph of the function{%endintlink%}
$f(x,y)$.  Otherwise, the surface can be viewed as being
{% intlink surface_defined_implicitly%}defined implicitly from
the equation{%endintlink%}.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the plot of a surface in three dimensions is more
difficult to draw and visualize that plots of curves in two dimensions.
We can often get insight into a surface by making a series
of plots of curves in two dimensions.  One way to do this is to
plot {%intlink level_sets level_curves%}level curves{%endintlink%}.
If the surface is the graph
of a function $z=f(x,y)$, then by fixing the variable $z$ to a single value $z=c$, one obtains a level curve
of the function $c=f(x,y)$.</p>

<p>Cross sections are generalizations of level curves to holding any one of the
three variables $x$, $y$, or $z$ fixed.  One can take cross sections of surfaces defined implicitly as well as graphs of functions.  We often refer to the cross sections where $z$ is fixed as <em>horizontal</em> cross sections (for graphs of functions, we can call them {%intlink level_sets level_curves%}level curves{%endintlink%}).  We often refer to cross sections where either $x$ or $y$ is fixed as <em>vertical</em> cross sections.  </p>

<p>For example, consider the following equation of a sphere of radius 2:
$$x^2 + y^2 + z^2= 4.$$
To examine a cross section, we choose a value for one of the three variables, say $z=0$. Using that value, we take a look at the resulting new equation:
$$x^2 + y^2 + 0^2 = 4, \qquad  \text{or} \qquad  x^2 + y^2 = 4.$$
</p>

<p>You should recognize this as a circle of radius 2, centered at the point $(x,y)=(0,0)$. In other words, the intersection of the plane $z=0$ and the sphere $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4$ is a circle of radius 2.  A more intuitive way to think about this is that you take a big meat cleaver and chop the sphere where $z=0$. If you take one of the resulting half-spheres, what does the edge look like?  A circle of radius two.</p>

<p>The below picture is an illustration of this cross section. You can see where the plane $z=0$ slices through the sphere.</p>

<p>This method can help you figure out what surfaces look like.  
It is particularly nice for the {% intlink quadric_surfaces%}quadric surfaces{%endintlink%}, as the cross sections are all familar conic sections.
When you put together the cross sections for $x$, $y$, and $z$, 
you develop a picture of the surface. </p>
