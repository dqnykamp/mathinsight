{% title "Translation, rescaling, and reflection" %}
{% description "An illustration using interactive graphics how to translate, rescale, and reflect graphs of functions of two variables." %}

<p>If you are given the graph of a function $z=f(x,y)$, how can you find
the graph of the function $z=a\,f(x-x_0,y-y_0)+c$ for some numbers
$a$, $c$, $x_0$, and $y_0$?</p>

<p>This is exactly analogous to what you've probably already done in
one-variable calculus.  Changing these numbers (we'll call them
parameters) results in a translation, rescaling, and/or reflection of
the graph.</p>

<p>Below is an applet that
illustrates these manipulations using the function $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$.
Before you play with the sliders, can you tell what will
happen as you change the parameters?  Once you start to move them, it
is obvious.  Make sure you understand why the parameters behave as
they do.  In particular, why do we need to put a minus sign in front
of $x_0$ and $y_0$ but not in front of $c$? After all, they each
introduce translations.</p>


<p>Here's the graph of the function $$ z=af(x-x_0,y-y_0)+c = a\left[(x-x_0)^2 +
  (y-y_0)^2\right] +c. $$</p>

{% boxedapplet "translation_rescaling_reflection" %}

<p>Changing $x_0$, $y_0$, or $c$ translates the graph.  If we change $a$
but keep its sign constant (for example, keep $a$ positive), then we
rescale the figure.  But if we change the sign of $a$, then we reflect
the graph across the plane $z=c$.  For example, the graph of
$z=-f(x,y)$ is the reflection of the graph of $z=f(x,y)$ across the
$xy$-plane (the plane $z=0$).</p>

Implicit surfaces

The same principles hold for surfaces defined implicitly, i.e.,
surfaces defined by an equation $F(x,y,z)=0$.  For example, the
equation for a sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin is
$x^2+y^2+z^2=1$.  If $F(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2+z^2-1$, then $F(x-a,x-b,x-c)=0$
is the equation for a sphere of radius 1 centered at the point
$(a,b,c)$.  Can you see that the equation
\begin{align*}
  F\left(\frac{x-a}{r},\frac{y-b}{r},\frac{z-c}{r}\right)=0
\end{align*}
is the equation for the sphere of radius $r$ centered at the point
$(a,b,c)$?  I don't have a CVT prepared for this.  Let me know if you
think you need one.  You'll go one step beyond this in the computer
lab (though you won't cover translations).
