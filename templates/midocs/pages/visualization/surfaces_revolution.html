<p>Surfaces of revolution are graphs of functions $f(x,y)$ that depend 
only on the the distance of the point $(x,y)$ to the origin.
One way to discuss such surfaces is in terms of polar 
coordinates $(r,\theta)$.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "polar_coordinates" %}</p>

<p>The coordinate $r$ is the radius from the origin to the point $P$
(or the distance to the origin)
and $\theta$ is the angle from the positive $x$-axis.  You may recall that we can
express the radius $r$ in terms of rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates
by $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.  The set of all points where $r$ is constant is
a circle of radius $r$ centered around the origin.</p>

<p>Let's say we had a function $f(x,y)$ of a special form so that it
depended only on the radius $r$, i.e., depended on $x$ and $y$ only
via the expression $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.  In this case, if we changed $x$
and $y$ in such a way that $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ didn't change, then the
value of the function $f(x,y)$ would not change.  Combining this
observation with our knowledge about $r$, we conclude that $f(x,y)$ is
constant along any circle centered around the origin.</p>

<p>What we've just described is a function of the form $f(x,y)=
g\bigl(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\bigr)$, where $g(r)$ is some one-variable
function.  We know, for example, that the function $f(x,y)$ is
constant on the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, because for
any point $(x,y)$ where $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=2$, the value of the function
$f(x,y)$ is $g(2)$.</p>

<p>This property makes it simple to graph the surface $z=f(x,y)$ because
it follows directly from the graph the curve $z=g(r)$.  And you
already know how to graph a one-variable function.</p>

<p>To graph $f(x,y)$, we take advantage of the fact that it doesn't
change as we rotate around the origin in the $xy$-plane.  In
three dimensions, the $z$-axis would be pointing out of the screen in
the above figure illustrating polar coordinates.  Hence, this rotation corresponds to rotation around
the $z$-axis.  The graph of $f(x,y)$ is the graph of $g(r)$
rotated around the $z$-axis.  For this reason, the resulting surface
is a called a <b>surface of revolution</b>.</p>

<p>To illustrate, we'll show how the plot of
\begin{gather*}
  z=f(x,y) = \frac{\sin \sqrt{x^2+y^2}}
  {\sqrt{x^2+y^2}+1}
\end{gather*}
is a surface of revolution.  Since $f(x,y)$ depends on $x$ and $y$
only via the combination $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, we can rewrite $f(x,y)$
as $f(x,y)= g\bigl(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\bigr)$, where
\begin{gather*}
  g(r) =\frac{\sin r}
  {r+1}.
\end{gather*}
Here's a plot of $g(r)$.</p>

<p>To help you visualize the relationship between the plot of $g(r)$ and 
the surface of revolution $z=f(x,y)$,  you can
transform between the plot of $g(r)$ and the plot of $f(x,y)$ by
changing the rotation angle $\theta$ in the following applet. </p>

<p>Can you recognize that each of these is a surface of revolution?</p>
<ul>
<li>$\displaystyle z=\frac{1}{1+x^2+y^2}$</li>
<li>$z=e^{(x^2+y^2)^3}$</li>
<li>$z=\sin(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})-x^2-y^2$</li>
</ul>
