<h4>Implicit curves</h4>
<p>A graph of a scalar-valued function of a single variable, $y=f(x)$, 
is a curve.  Graph the equation $y=f(x)$ is easy because the value
of $y$ is given explicitly for each value of $x$.  Even if we aren't told
what the function is, we can easily graph an equation such as $y=(x-1)^2$
since it is solved explicitly for $y$.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, 
we want to graph an equation such
as the equation $x^2+y^2=1$.  
You might recall that equations like these are called implicit functions, because we can't explicitly solve for $y$ in terms of $x$.  
If you try to solve this equation for $y$, you get $y = \pm \sqrt{1-x^2}$.
The graph of such an equation is still well defined.  
It is the set of points $(x,y)$ where $x^2+y^2=1$, which is 
the circle of radius one centered at the origin.</p>

<h4>Implicit surfaces</h4>

<p>We can also graph equations in terms of three variables, say
$x$, $y$, and $z$.  Sometimes, we can solve the equation explicitly in
terms of $z$ and write it as $z=f(x,y)$.  In this case, we've reduced the
problem to the {% intlink "surface_graph_function" %}graph of a scalar-function 
of two variables{%endintlink%}, which is a surface.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we cannot solve an equation like $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$
explicitly for $z$.  Even so, the equation still implicitly defines 
a surface.  The surface, i.e., the graph of the equation, is the
set of points $(x,y,z)$ that satisfy $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$.  These points form a
sphere of radius one centered at the origin.</p>

<p>For additional examples of implicit surfaces, look at the {% intlink "quadric_surfaces" %}quadric surfaces{%endintlink%},
many of which are defined implicitly.  In addition, the {% intlink "level_sets" anchor="level_surfaces" %}level surfaces{%endintlink%} used to visualize the functions of three variables are generally implicit surfaces.</p>
