<div class="highlight"><h4>The elliptic paraboloid</h4>
<p>Equation: $z=Ax^2+By^2$<br/>
(where A and B have the same sign)</p>
</div>
</center>

<p>This is probably the simplest of all the quadric surfaces, and it's often the first one shown in class. It has a distinctive &ldquo;nose-cone&rdquo; appearance.</p>

<p>This surface is called an elliptic paraboloid because the vertical {% intlink "surface_cross_sections" %}cross sections{%endintlink%} are all parabolas, while the horizontal cross sections are ellipses. Occasionally we get sloppy and just refer to it simply as a paraboloid; that wouldn't be a problem, except that it leads to confusion with the {% intlink "hyperbolic_paraboloid" %}hyperbolic paraboloid{%endintlink%}.</p>

<p>The cross sections below are for the simplest possible elliptic paraboloid:
$$z = x^2 + y^2.$$</p>

{% boxedapplet "elliptic_paraboloid_cross_sections" %}

<p>One important feature of the vertical cross sections is that the parabolas all open in the same direction. That isn't true for {% intlink "hyperbolic_paraboloid" %}hyperbolic paraboloids{%endintlink%}!</p>

<p>Note that in this case, the horizontal cross sections are actually circles, but this isn't always the case. In fact, whenever $A$ and $B$ are not equal, the paraboloid will be wider in one direction than the other.</p>

<p>You can use the below applet to investigate how these coefficients affect the shape of the surface. On the left, it shows the paraboloid $z = A x^2 + B y^2$ over the square domain
\begin{gather*}
-2 \le x \le 2\\
-2 \le y \le 2.
\end{gather*}
On the right, the domain is a disk, and it shows the portion of the paraboloid for which $0 \le z \le 8$. When you change A and B, the domain will change accordingly.</p>

<p class="pre_list">Here are a few things to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens if either $A$ or $B$ is 0? What if they both are? Should any of these objects be called &ldquo;elliptic&rdquo; paraboloids?</li>
<li>What would happen if the sliders included negative values for $A$ and $B$? (Click {% intlink "paraboloid_changeable" class="applet" %}here{% endintlink %} to experiment and see if you're right.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The elliptic paraboloid was used to motivate the notion of {% intlink "level_sets" anchor="level_curves" %}level curves{%endintlink%}.  Can you see that the level curves are equivalent to the above horizontal cross sections?</p>
