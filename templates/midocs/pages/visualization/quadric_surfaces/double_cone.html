<p>The double cone is a very important {% intlink "quadric_surfaces" %}quadric surface{%endintlink%}, if for no other reason than the fact that it's used to define the so-called conics -- ellipses, hyperbolas, and parabolas -- all of which can be created as the intersection of a plane and a double cone. See any PreCalculus or Calculus textbook for pictures of this.</p>

<p>The vertical {% intlink "surface_cross_sections" %}cross sections{%endintlink%} of a double cone are hyperbolas, while the horizontal cross sections are ellipses. The below applet shows the cone where $A=B=1$.</p>

{% boxedapplet "double_cone_cross_sections" %}

<p>Look back at the equation for the double cone. Sometimes we manipulate it to get a single cone. If we solve for $z$, we end up with a plus/minus sign in front of a square root. The positive square root represents the top of the cone; the negative square root gives you an equation for the bottom. Be careful if somebody says &ldquo;cone&rdquo; without elaborating; they might mean &ldquo;double cone&rdquo; or &ldquo;single cone,&rdquo; depending on the context.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, the constants $A$ and $B$ determine how &ldquo;steep&rdquo; the cone is in the $x$ and $y$ direction, respectively. You can get a feel from this in the second applet, below, which at the left shows the portion of a cone for which $x$ and $y$ are between -1 and 1.  In the right panel, the domain is a disk, and it shows the portion of the cone for which $-4 \le z \le 4.$</p>

<p class="pre_list">After you've played around with the examples for awhile, see if you can answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why aren't any of the vertical or horizontal cross sections parabolas?</li>
<li>Explain what happens when either $A=0$ or $B=0$. Why don't you get a cone?</li>
<li>Similarly, what are the cross sections given by $x=0$ or $y=0$? Are these hyperbolas?</li>
</ul>
