<div class="highlight"><h4>The hyperboloid of two sheets</h4>
<p>Equation:  $\displaystyle-\frac{x^2}{A^2}-\frac{y^2}{B^2} + \frac{z^2}{C^2} = 1$</p>
</div>

<p>The hyperboloid of two sheets looks an awful lot like two {% intlink "elliptic_paraboloid" %}(elliptic) paraboloids{%endintlink%} facing each other. It's a complicated surface, mainly because it comes in two pieces. All of its vertical {% intlink "surface_cross_sections" %}cross sections{%endintlink%} exist -- and are hyperbolas -- but there's a problem with the horizontal cross sections.</p>

<p>This problem is evident in the below applet, where you can see the cross sections of
$$-x^2-y^2+z^2 = 1.$$</p>

{% boxedapplet "hyperboloid_two_sheets_cross_sections" %}

<p>The horizontal cross sections are generally ellipses, except that there are no horizontal cross sections when $z$ is between -1 and 1. To see why this happens, look at the equation above. Suppose $z=0$. Then the left hand side is definitely negative, but the right hand side is definitely positive. There's no way to fix this, so the cross section simply doesn't exist!</p>

<p>Here's a hint about telling the two kinds of hyperboloids apart: look at the cross sections $x=0$, $y=0$, and $z=0$. If they exist, then it's a {% intlink "hyperboloid_one_sheet" %}hyperboloid of one sheet{%endintlink%}. (Go back to {% intlink "hyperboloid_one_sheet" %}that page{%endintlink%} and convince yourself that its cross sections all exist.) If you end up with something negative equal to something positive, then you've got a two-sheeter.</p>

<p>By now you probably expect that larger values of $A$, $B$, and $C$ make for a much steeper surface, right? Wrong! It's true that making $C$ larger will have a dramatic effect on the surface, but use the below applet to find out what happens when you increase $A$ and $B$. Surprised?</p>

{% boxedapplet "hyperboloid_two_sheets_coefficients" %}

<p>Go back to the equation and figure out why larger values of $A$ and $B$ make the hyperboloid flatter, not steeper.</p>

<p>Does there always need to be a gap between the two sheets, or could they touch?</p>
