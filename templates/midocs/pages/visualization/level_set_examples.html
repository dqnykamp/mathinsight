<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>Let $f(x,y) = x^2-y^2$.  We will study the level curves $c=x^2-y^2$.</p>

<p>First, look at the case $c=0$.  The level curve equation $x^2-y^2=0$
factors to $(x-y)(x+y)=0$.   This equation is satisfied if either
$y=x$ or $y=-x$.  Both these are equations for lines, so the level
curve for $c=0$ is two lines.</p>

<p>If $c \ne 0$, then we can rewrite the level curve equation $c=x^2-y^2$ as
\begin{align*}
  1 = \frac{x^2}{c} - \frac{y^2}{c}.
\end{align*}
If you remember you conic sections, you'll recognize this as the
equation for a hyperbola.  If $c$ is positive, the hyperbolas open to
the left and right.  If $c$ is negative, the hyperbolas open up and
down.</p>

<p>For example, if $c=1$, the equation is $x^2-y^2=1$.  If $c=-1$, the
equation is $y^2-x^2=1$.  A number of level curves are plotted below.</p>

<p>We can &ldquo;stack&rdquo; these level curves on top of one another to form the
graph of the function.  Below, the level curves are the thick blue
lines.  Drag the green point from 0 to 1.  When the point is at 1,
each level curve given by $c=f(x,y)$ will be at the height $z=c$.</p>

<p>This is yet another way to visualize the relationship between the
level curves and the graph of $z=f(x,y)$ shown below, which is a {% intlink "hyperbolic_paraboloid" %}hyperbolic paraboloid{%endintlink%}.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Let $f(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2+z^2$.  Although we cannot plot the graph of
this function, we can graph some of its level surfaces.  The equation
for a level surface, $x^2+y^2+z^2=c$, is the equation for a sphere of
radius $\sqrt{c}$. </p>
