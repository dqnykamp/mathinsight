{% description "Illustration of how the graph of a scalar-valued function of two variables is a surface." %}

<p>If $f$ is a scalar-valued function of a single variable, $f:\R \to \R$ {% confusedlink function_notation %}, 
then the graph of $f$ is the set of points $(x,f(x))$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.  When often call this
the graph of $y=f(x)$, since we think of the points as lying in the $xy$-plane.  When plotting the points in the $xy$-plane, they typically form a curve a points, such as the graph
of $f(x)=\sin x$ shown below.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image graph_sin_x %}</p>

<p>We define the graph of a scalar-valued function of two variables, 
$f: \R^2 \to \R$ in the same way.  The graph is the set of points
$(x,y,f(x,y))$ for all $(x,y)$ in the domain of $f$.  
When often call this
the graph of $z=f(x,y)$, since we think of the points as lying in
$xyz$-space.  You may not find this formal definition particularly enlightening,
but we can show how the graph of $f(x,y)$ is a surface.</p>

<p>The function f takes two inputs, $x$ and $y$, and returns a single number, which we call $z$.  
If we draw the $x$-$y$-$z$ coordinate axes in the standard way, 
the $z$-axis represents height, and this is the key to graphing $f(x,y)$.
If you choose a point $(x,y)$ in the $xy$-plane, then $z=f(x,y)$ represents the height of the graph at that point.  
For example, here's the graph of a simple function, $g(x,y)=1$.  
No matter what values you choose for $x$ and $y$, 
the function $g$ will always return (&ldquo;a height of&rdquo;) one.</p>


{% boxedapplet horizontal_plane %}

<p class="pre_list">The graph of the single variable function $g(x)$ is
a line with slope 1 through the origin.  Can you envision what the 
graph of its generalization to two variables, the function $g(x,y)=x+y$, 
will look like?  It won't be a line, but a plane.
This graph will not have a constant height of one, but you should be able to make some observations:</p>
<ul><li>If $y=-x$, then $g(x,y)=0$.</li>
<li>If $x$ and $y$ are both positive, then $g(x,y) > 0$.</li>
<li>If $x$ and $y$ are both negative, then $g(x,y) <0$.</li>
<li>If you fix either $x$ or $y$ and increase the other variable, the function will increase with a slope of one.</p>
</ul>
<p>Can you see if these are true from the graph?</p>

{% boxedapplet angled_plane %}


<p>One thing you have to notice is that the $z$-axis goes from -2 to 2, which means the &ldquo;height&rdquo; is zero halfway up the box, not at the bottom. 
The slopes of the plane are hard to visualize as the $z$-axis is scaled differently than the $x$- and $y$-axes.  
If we scaled all the axes with the same scale, we get a more accurate
picture of how steep the plane is.  In the below plot, if you look at any of the edges
of the graph (along which one of the variables is fixed), you can 
better see that the height (the $z$ direction) increases with slope of one.

<p>Let's plot a few more examples.  You may recall that the graph of the
single variable function $f(x)=x^2$ is a parabola.  
The graph of the function $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$ is a generalization 
to two variables.  The graph is something called a {%intlink elliptic_paraboloid%}paraboloid{%endintlink%}, a type 
of {% intlink quadric_surfaces%}quadric surface{%endintlink%}.</p>

{% boxedapplet graph_elliptic_paraboloid_2 %}

<p>One can, of course, plot the graphs of all sorts of  functions.  Some of the most interesting involve trigonometric functions, such as $f(x,y)=\sin(xy)$.</p>
