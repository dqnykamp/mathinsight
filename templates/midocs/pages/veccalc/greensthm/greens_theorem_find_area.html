{% description "A trick to use Green's theorem to calculate the area of a region" %}
<p>Typically we use {%intlink greens_theorem_idea%}Green's theorem{%endintlink%}
as an alternative way to
calculate a line integral $\dlint$.  If, for example, we are in two
dimension, $\dlc$ is a
{% intlink simple_curve_definition %}simple{%endintlink%}
{% intlink closed_curve_definition %}closed{%endintlink%}
curve, and $\dlvf(x,y)$ is defined
everywhere inside $\dlc$, we can use Green's theorem to convert the
line integral into to double integral.  Instead of calculating line
integral $\dlint$ directly, we calculate the double integral
\begin{align*}
  \iint_\dlr \left(\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} -
    \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}\right) dA  
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>Can we use Green's theorem to go the other direction?  If we are given
a double integral, can we use Green's theorem to convert the double
integral into a line integral and calculate the line integral?  If we
are given the double integral
\begin{align*}
  \iint_\dlr f(x,y) dA,
\end{align*}
we can use Green's theorem only if there happens to be a vector field
$\dlvf(x,y)$ so that 
\begin{align*}
  f(x,y) = \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} -
    \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}.
\end{align*}
However, we haven't learned any method to find such a vector field
$\dlvf$.  So, we aren't likely to use Green's theorem in this
direction very often. </p>

<p>There is one important exception to this rule, however, and that is
when we are using a double integral to calculate the area of a region $\dlr$. 
{%intlink double_integral_area %}The area of a region{%endintlink%} $\dlr$ is equal to
the double integral of $f(x,y)=1$ over $\dlr$:
\begin{align*}
  \text{Area of $\dlr$} = \iint_\dlr dA = \iint_\dlr 1\, dA.
\end{align*}
If $f(x,y) =1$, it is easy to find a vector field $\dlvf$ so that
\begin{align*}
  \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} -
    \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}  = f(x,y) = 1.
\end{align*}
There are many such vector fields $\dlvf$, but we'll pick the vector
field $\dlvf(x,y) = (-y/2, x/2)$.  You can confirm that indeed
$\displaystyle \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y} =1$.</p>

<p>In summary, if $\dlc$ is a counterclockwise oriented simple closed
curve that bounds a region where you can apply Green's theorem, the
area of the region $\dlr$ bounded by $\dlc = \partial \dlr$ is
\begin{align*}
  \text{Area of $\dlr$} = \dlint = \frac{1}{2} \int_\dlc x\,dy - y\,dx,
\end{align*}
where $\dlvf(x,y) = (-y/2,x/2)$.</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>Use Green's Theorem to calculate the area of the disk $\dlr$ of radius $r$ defined
by $x^2+y^2 \le r^2$.  </p>

<p><b>Solution</b>:  Since we know the area of the disk of radius $r$ is
$\pi r^2$, we better get $\pi r^2$ for our answer.</p>

<p>The boundary of $\dlr$ is the circle of radius $r$.  We can parametrized
it in a counterclockwise orientation using
\begin{align*}
  \dllp(t) = (r\cos t, r\sin t), \quad 0 \le t \le 2\pi.
\end{align*}
Then 
\begin{align*}
  \dllp'(t) = (-r\sin t, r\cos t),
\end{align*}
and, by Green's theorem,
\begin{align*}
  \text{area of } \dlr &amp;= \iint dA\\
  &amp;=  \frac{1}{2} \int_\dlc x\,dy - y\,dx\\
  &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{2\pi} [(r\cos t)(r\cos t) - (r\sin t)(-r\sin t)]dt
  \\
  &amp;=
  \frac{1}{2}  \int_0^{2\pi} r^2 (\sin^2t+\cos^2t) dt = \frac{r^2}{2}\int_0^{2\pi}
  dt
  = \pi r^2.
\end{align*}
Thankfully, our answer agrees with what we know it should be.</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>Calculate the area of the region $D$ bounded by the curve $\dlc$ parametrized by $\dllp(t)=\sin 2t\,\vc{i} +\sin t\,\vc{j}$ for $0 \le t \le \pi$.  The region and curve are illustrated by the below applet.</p>

{%boxedapplet area_inside_sinusoidal_curve %}

<p><b>Solution</b>: 
We'll use Green's theorem to calculate the area bounded by the curve.  
Since $\dlc$ is a counterclockwise oriented boundary of $D$, the area is just the line integral of the vector field $\dlvf(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}(-y,x)$ around the curve $\dlc$ parametrized by $\dllp(t)$.</p>

<p>To integrate around $\dlc$, we need to calculate  the derivative of the parametrization
$\dllp'(t)=2\cos 2t \,\vc{i}+\cos t\,\vc{j}$.  Then, by Green's theorem, we turn the double integral defining the area into line integral and calculate the area.
\begin{align*}
  \text{area of } \dlr &amp;= \iint dA\\
  &amp;=  \dlint =  \plint{0}{\pi}{\dlvf}{\dllp}\\
  &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{\pi} ( -\sin t, \sin 2t) \cdot ( 2\cos 2t,\cos t)dt\\
  &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{\pi} ( -\sin t, 2 \sin t \cos t ) \cdot (2\cos^2 t - 2\sin^2 t,\cos t)dt\\
  &amp;=  \int_0^{\pi} \sin^3t dt
  =\int_0^{\pi} (\sin t-\sin t\,\cos^2t)\, dt\\
  &amp;= \Bigl[-\cos t -\frac{1}{3}\cos^3 t\Bigr]_0^{\pi}
  = 1+\frac{1}{3}=\frac{4}{3}
\end{align*}
