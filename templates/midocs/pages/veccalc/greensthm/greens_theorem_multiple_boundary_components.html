<p>In our {% intlink "greens_theorem_idea" %}initial presentation of Green's theorem{%endintlink%},
we stated that the total 
circulation of a vector field $\dlvf$ around a {% intlink "closed_curve_definition" %}closed curve{%endintlink%} $\dlc$ in
the plane is equal to the double integral of the &ldquo;microscopic
circulation&rdquo; over the region $\dlr$ inside $\dlc$,
\begin{align*}
  \lint{\partial \dlr}{\dlvf} = \iint_\dlr \left( \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}\right)dA.
\end{align*}
({% intlink "greens_theorem_other_ways_writing" %}Here we write{%endintlink%}
$\dlc=\partial \dlr$ to show that $\dlc$ was the boundary of $\dlr$.)
We illustrated the idea behind Green's theorem with this sketch
showing the &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo; in $\dlr$ as little green
oriented circles.  We need $\dlc$ to be oriented in a counterclockwise
fashion.  Although we didn't stress it in the initial reading, Green's
theorem, of course, requires that $\dlvf$ be defined everywhere inside
$\dlr$.</p>

<p>As usual, we like to keep our initial presentations as simple as
possible, so we don't include all possible complications.  It turns
out that Green's theorems applies to more general regions that just
those bounded by just one simple closed curve.  We can also use
Green's theorem for regions $\dlr$ with holes in them, such as with
the region between the red and the blue curves sketched below.
In this case, the requirement is that $\dlvf$ is defined everywhere in
$\dlr$, though it doesn't need to be defined inside the holes.</p>


<p class="centeredImage">{% image "microscopic_circulation_region_hole" %}</p>

<p>In the above picture, $\dlr$ has a single hole in it.  Hence, the
boundary $\partial \dlr$ has two components (the red and the
blue curves).  Green's theorem still says that the integral of the
&ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo; in $\dlr$ is equal to the line integral of
$\dlvf$ around the boundary.  But now the line integral of $\dlvf$
around the boundary is really two integrals: the integral around the
blue curve plus the integral around the red curve.  If we call
the blue curve $\dlc_1$ and the red curve $\dlc_2$, then we can
write Green's theorem as
\begin{align*}
  \lint{\dlc_1}{\dlvf} + \lint{\dlc_2}{\dlvf}
  = \iint_\dlr
  \left( \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}\right)dA.
\end{align*}
</p>


<p>The only remaining question is how to orient $\dlc_1$ and $\dlc_2$.
Just as in the top picture without a hole, we require that the outer
boundary $\dlc_1$ be oriented in a counterclockwise fashion.  Notice
that with this choice, the orientation of $\dlc_1$ matches the
orientation of the green circles.  For example, the top parts of the
green circles are oriented to the left.  Since the tops of the green
circles touch the top of $\dlc_1$, the top part of $\dlc_1$ must be
oriented to the left in order to match.  Both the green circles and
$\dlc_1$ must have a counterclockwise orientation.</p>

<p>Now, look closely at the orientation of the green circles near
$\dlc_2$ (the inner red curve).  Again, the orientation of $\dlc_2$
must match the direction of the green circles.  But, this time, the
tops of the green circles touch the <b>bottom</b> of $\dlc_2$.
Since the tops of the green circles are oriented to the left, the
bottom of $\dlc_2$ must also be oriented to the left.  This means
$\dlc_2$ must actually be oriented in a <b>clockwise</b> fashion.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "macroscopic_microscopic_circulation_hole" %}</p>

<p>We end up with a simple formula for determining the orienations of all
the parts of the boundary $\dlc = \partial \dlr$.  The outer boundary
must have a counterclockwise orientation.  Any inner boundaries
surrounding holes in $\dlr$ must have a clockwise orientation.
{% intlink "greens_theorem_idea" %}As before{%endintlink%},
 we say that
such a $\partial \dlr$ is a positively oriented boundary of $\dlr$.</p>

<p>We can also describe the requirement for a positively oriented
boundary using the right hand rule (which is how we'll discuss
orientation of boundaries in the closely related
{% intlink "stokes_theorem_idea" %}Stokes' Theorem{%endintlink%}).  The
&ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo; denoted by the little green circles is
oriented to coincide with the orientation of the curled fingers of
your right hand if you point your right thumb out of the computer
screen.  If you place your right hand with thumb up in the region
$\dlr$ and move it so that your fingers are next to any of the
boundary components, the orientation of the boundary must coincide
with the direction of your fingers.  For the right hand rule to work,
it is crucial that your hand be inside the region $\dlr$.  In this
case, your hand will be inside $\dlc_1$, showing that $\dlc_1$ must be
oriented counterclockwise.  Since your hand must be outside of
$\dlc_2$ to be inside $\dlr$, the right hand rule shows $\dlc_2$ must
be oriented clockwise.
