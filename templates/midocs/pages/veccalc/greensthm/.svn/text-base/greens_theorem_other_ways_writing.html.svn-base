{% description "Small variations in the way you can write Green's theorem" %}

<p>In the {% intlink greens_theorem_idea %}introductory page on Green's theorem{%endintlink%}, we wrote Green's theorem as
\begin{align*}
  \dlint = \iint_\dlr (\curl \dlvf) \cdot \vc{k} \, dA
\end{align*}
or
\begin{align*}
  \dlint = \iint_\dlr \left( \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}\right)dA,
\end{align*}
where $\dlvf(x,y) = (\dlvfc_1(x,y),\dlvfc_2(x,y))$ is a
two-dimensional vector field, $\dlr$ is a region in plane, and $\dlc$
is its positively oriented boundary.  This notation to ties
Green's theorem nicely in with the concept of the 
{%intlink curl_idea %}curl of a vector field{%endintlink%}.</p>

<p>We often denote $\dlc$ by $\partial \dlr$ to make it explicit that the
curve $\dlc$ is the (positively oriented) boundary of $\dlr$.  This
notation is also more natural when the region $\dlr$
{% intlink greens_theorem_multiple_boundary_components %}has more than one boundary component{%endintlink%}.  Then, Green's theorem can
look like, for example,
\begin{align*}
  \lint{\partial \dlr}{\dlvf} = \iint_\dlr \left(
    \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}\right)dA,
\end{align*}
Note that the notation $\partial \dlr$ simply means the boundary of
$\dlr$.  It has nothing to do with a partial derivative.</p>

<p>People frequently write Green's theorem another way.  First,
they like to change the formula by writing the line integral at the
left in terms of components:
\begin{align*}
 \int_{\partial \dlr} F_1\, dx + F_2\, dy = \iint_\dlr \left( \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}\right)dA.
\end{align*}
Then, they like to let the vector field be $\vc{F}(x,y) =(P(x,y),
Q(x,y))$, so that Green's theorem becomes
\begin{align*}
  \int_{\partial \dlr} P\, dx + Q\, dy= \iint_\dlr \left( \pdiff{Q}{x} 
    - \pdiff{P}{y}\right)dA.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>Sometimes, $\vc{F} = (P,Q)$ won't be referred to as a vector field.
Instead, one can discuss the above version of Green's theorem as
applied to the two scalar valued functions $Q : \dlr \to \R$ and $P :
\dlr \to \R$ {% confusedlink function_notation %}.</p>
