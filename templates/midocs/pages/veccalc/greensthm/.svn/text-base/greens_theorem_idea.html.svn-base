<p>When $\dlc$ is an 
{% intlink oriented_curve_definition%}oriented{%endintlink%}
{% intlink simple_curve_definition %}simple{%endintlink%}
{% intlink closed_curve_definition %}closed{%endintlink%} curve, the integral
\begin{align*}
  \dlint
\end{align*}
{%intlink line_integral_circulation %}represents the circulation{%endintlink%} of $\dlvf$ around $\dlc$.
If $\dlvf$ were the velocity field of water flow, for example, this
integral would indicate how much the water tends to circulate around
the path in the direction of its orientation.
</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image closed_curve %}</p>

<p>One way to compute this circulation is, of course, to compute the
{%intlink line_integral_vector_field_introduction %}line integral{%endintlink%} directly.
But, if our line integral happens to be in two dimensions (i.e.,
$\dlvf$ is a two-dimensional vector field and $\dlc$ is a closed path
that lives in the plane), then Green's theorem applies and we can use
Green's theorem as an alternative way to calculate the line integral.</p>

<p>Green's theorem transforms the line integral around $\dlc$ into a
{% intlink double_integral_introduction %}double integral{%endintlink%} over the
region inside $\dlc$.  However, it's not obvious what function we
should integrate over the region inside $\dlc$ so that we still get
the same answer as the line integral.  The notion of circulation can aid us in 
determining what this function should be.</p>

<p>Think of the integral $\dlint$ as the &ldquo;macroscopic&rdquo; circulation of the
vector field $\dlvf$ around the path $\dlc$.  Now, imagine you came up
with a &ldquo;microscopic&rdquo; version of circulation around a curve.  This
microscopic circulation at a point $(x,y)$ has to tell you how much
$\dlvf$ would circulate around a tiny closed curve centered around
$(x,y)$.  We could picture the microscopic circulation as a bunch of
small closed curves (shown below in green), where each curve
respresents the tendency for the vector field to circulate at that
location (imagine that the small curves were really, really small,
much smaller than pictured).</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image microscopic_circulation %}</p>

<p>Green's theorem is simply a relationship between the macroscopic
circulation around the curve $\dlc$ and the sum of all the
microscopic circulation that is inside $\dlc$.  If $\dlc$ is a simple closed
curve in the plane (remember, we are talking about two dimensions),
then it surrounds some region $\dlr$ (shown in red) in the plane.
$\dlr$ is the &ldquo;interior&rdquo; of the curve $\dlc$.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image closed_curve_region %}</p>

<p>Green's theorem says that if you add up all the microscopic
circulation inside $\dlc$ (i.e., the microscopic circulation in
$\dlr$), then that total is exactly the same as the macroscopic
circulation around $\dlc$.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image macroscopic_microscopic_circulation %}</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adding up&rdquo; the microscopic circulation in $\dlr$ means taking the double
integral of the microscopic circulation over $\dlr$.  Therefore, we can
write Green's theorem as
\begin{align*}
  \dlint = \iint_\dlr \text{&ldquo;microscopic
  circulation of $\dlvf$&rdquo; } dA.
\end{align*}</p>

<p>
What is this microscopic circulation?  The microscopic circulation of
Green's theorem is the same as the microscopic circulation of the
{% intlink curl_idea %}curl{%endintlink%} of a
three-dimensional vector field.   The only difference is that
Green's theorem applies only with two-dimensional vector fields, e.g.,
for vector fields in the $xy$-plane.  The microscropic circulation we
want is circulation in the $xy$-plane.</p>

<p>Microscopic circulation in the $xy$ plane turns out to be the
$z$-component of the curl.  You can see this as follows.  The
direction of the {% intlink curl_idea %}curl{%endintlink%} and the
{% intlink curl_components %}definition of its components{%endintlink%} is
determined by the right-hand rule.  (Imagine curling the fingers of
your right hand around the circles indicating the circulation.  One
represents such circulation by a vector pointing in the direction of
your thumb.)  In three-dimensions, point the thumb of your right
hand in the positive $z$ direction.  Then, the fingers of your right
hand curl in the counterclockwise direction parallel to the
$xy$-plane.  So, the right-hand rule says that circulation in the
$xy$-plane should correspond to the $z$-component of the curl.</p>


<p>We conclude that, for Green's theorem,
\begin{align*}
  \text{&ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo;} = (\curl \dlvf) \cdot \vc{k},
\end{align*}
(where $\vc{k}$ is the {% intlink unit_vector_definition %}unit vector{%endintlink%} in the $z$-direction) and we can
write Green's theorem as
\begin{align*}
  \dlint = \iint_\dlr (\curl \dlvf) \cdot \vc{k} \, dA.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>The {% intlink curl_components %}component of the curl{%endintlink%}
in the $z$-direction is given by the formula
\begin{align*}
  (\curl \dlvf) \cdot \vc{k} = \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} -
  \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}.
\end{align*}
{% index_entry "scalar curl" "" "scalar_curl" %}
{% index_entry "curl" "scalar" "scalar_curl1" %}
This $z$-component of the curl is often termed the <i>scalar curl</i> of a two-dimensional
vector field.
You can {% intlink curl_components %}get intuition{%endintlink%}
behind this formula or see 
{% intlink circulation_unit_area_calculation %}how to derive{%endintlink%}
this formula from the {% intlink curl_definition_line_integral %}definition
of the curl{%endintlink%}.
Using this formula, we can write Green's theorem as 
\begin{align*}
  \dlint = \iint_\dlr \left( \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}\right)dA.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>To make sure that Green's theorem gives the right answer, 
we need to be careful how we orient the curve $\dlc$.  
The right hand rule says that $(\curl \dlvf) \cdot \vc{k}$
corresponds to the amount of circulation in the counterclockwise
direction.  Hence, Green's theorem, as we have written it, is valid
only for curves oriented counterclockwise (as pictured above).  In
this case, we say that $\dlc$ is a <i>positively oriented</i>
boundary of the region $\dlr$.  One way to remember what positively
oriented means is the following: if you were to walk along $\dlc$ in the
positive orientation, the region $\dlr$ will be to your left.  If you
mess up the orientation, you'll be off by a minus sign.

<h4>Green's theorem and other fundamental theorems</h4>

<p>Green's theorem is one of the
{% intlink fundamental_theorems_vector_calculus_summary %}four fundamental
theorems of vector calculus{%endintlink%}
all of which are closely linked.  
Once you learn about {% intlink surface_integral_vector_field_introduction %}surface
integrals{%endintlink%}, you can see how {% intlink stokes_theorem_idea %}Stokes'
theorem{%endintlink%} is based on the same principle of linking 
microscopic and macroscopic circulation. </p>

<p>What if a vector field had no microscopic circulation?
Looking at Green's theorem, we immediately see if this microscopic
circulation $\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}$ were
zero in some region $\dlr$, then the line integral
\begin{align*}
  \int_\dlc \dlvf \cdot d\vc{s}=0
\end{align*}
for any closed curve $\dlc$ in $\dlr$ 
(for example, the closed curve $\dlc$ that is the boundary of $\dlr$).
This is a {% intlink conservative_vector_field_no_circulation %}property{%endintlink%}
of {% intlink conservative_vector_field_introduction %}conservative
or path-independent{%endintlink%} vector fields,
which forms the basis for the {% intlink gradient_theorem_line_integrals %}gradient
theorem{%endintlink%} for line integrals.</p>
