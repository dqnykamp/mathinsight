{% title "A path-dependent vector field with zero curl" %}
{% description "A counterexample showing how a vector field could have zero curl but still fail to be conservative or path-independent. " %}

<p>
Our goal is to determine if the vector field
\begin{align*}
  \dlvf(x,y) = \left( \frac{-y}{x^2+y^2}, \frac{x}{x^2+y^2} \right)
\end{align*}
is conservative (also called path-independent).</p>

<p>One condition for path independence is 
{% intlink conservative_vector_field_determine test4 %}the following{%endintlink%}.  For
a {%intlink simply_connected_definition %}simply connected{%endintlink%} domain, a continuously differentiable vector field
$\dlvf$ is path-independent if and only if its curl is zero.</p>

<p>Since $\dlvf(x,y)$ is two dimensional, we need to check the scalar curl
\begin{align*}
  \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}.
\end{align*}
We calculate
\begin{align*}
  \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} &amp;=  \frac{1}{x^2+y^2} - \frac{x(2x)}{(x^2+y^2)^2} 
  = \frac{y^2-x^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}\\
  \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y} &amp;= -\frac{1}{x^2+y^2} +\frac{y(2y)}{(x^2+y^2)^2} 
  = \frac{y^2-x^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}.
\end{align*}
Since these partial derivatives are equal, the curl is zero.
</p>

<p>Can we conclude $\dlvf$ is conservative?  The problem is that
$\dlvf$ is not defined at the origin $(0,0)$.  Its domain of definition
has a hole in it, which for two-dimensional regions, is enough
to prevent it from being {%intlink simply_connected_definition%}simply connected{%endintlink%}.
The test does not apply, and we still don't know whether or not $\dlvf$ is conservative. </p>

<p>Let's try another test, this time a test for path-dependence.
If we can find a closed curve along which the integral of $\dlvf$ is nonzero, then 
{% intlink conservative_vector_field_determine test2 %}we can conclude{%endintlink%} that $\dlvf$ is path-dependent.  
If the curve does not go around the origin, then we can use
{% intlink greens_theorem_idea %}Green's theorem{%endintlink%} to
show the integral of $\dlvf$ zero,
\begin{align*}
  \lint{\adlc}{\dlvf}= \int_\dlr
  \left(\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x}-\pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}\right)
  dA = \int_\dlr 0 dA = 0,
\end{align*}
as the vector field is defined everywhere in the region $\dlr$ inside
the closed curve $\adlc$.</p>

<p>We must try a closed curve where Green's theorem does not apply, i.e.,
one that goes around the point at the origin where $\dlvf$ is not defined. 
We'll use the unit circle.</p>

<p>A counterclockwise parametrization of the unit circle is
$\dllp(t)=(\cos t, \sin t)$ for $0 \le t \le 2\pi$.  
On the unit circle, $\dlvf$ takes a simple form,
\begin{align*}
  \dlvf(\dllp(t)) &amp;= \dlvf(\cos t, \sin t) = \left(\frac{-\sin t}{\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t},
    \frac{\cos t}{\cos^2 t+ \sin^2 t}\right)\\
  &amp;= (-\sin t, \cos t).
\end{align*}
Therefore,
\begin{align*}
  \dlint &amp;= 
  \dplint\\
  &amp;=  \int_0^{2\pi}  (-\sin t, \cos t) \cdot  (-\sin t, \cos t) dt\\
  &amp;=  \int_0^{2\pi} (\sin^2 t + \cos^2 t) dt =  \int_0^{2\pi} 1\, dt = 2\pi.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>The hole in the domain at the origin did end up causing trouble.  
We found a curve $\dlc$ where the circulation around $\dlc$ is not zero.
The vector field $\dlvf$ is path-dependent.</p>

<p>This vector field is the two-dimensional analogue of one we used to 
illustrate the subtleties of curl, as it had {% intlink curl_subtleties curlfreecirc%}curl-free macroscopic circulation{%endintlink%}.
The circulation can be clearly seen by plotting the vector field
$\dlvf$.  It's difficult to plot, because the vector field blows up
at the origin. </p>

<p>Further insight into $\dlvf$ can be obtained from the fact that $\dlvf$ has 
a potential function if, for example, you restrict yourself to the 
right half-plane with $x>0$.  In this case, you can write $\dlvf(x,y)
= \nabla f(x,y)$, where $f(x,y) = \arctan(y/x)$.  Of course,
this potential function cannot be extended to the whole plane,
or we'd run into a contradiction with the fact that $\dlint \ne 0$
when $\dlc$ is the unit circle.  Besides not being defined along the line
$x=0$, it is also discontinuous across that line.
But, the existence of this potential function explains why the
curl should be zero away from the line $x=0$.
(The whole line $x=0$ isn't special for $\dlvf$, as the origin
is the only point that causes problems. You could, for example, use 
$f(x,y) = -\arctan(x/y)$ for a potential function away from the line $y=0$.)
