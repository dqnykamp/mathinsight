{% description "How a conservative, or path-independent, vector field will have no circulation around any closed curve." %}

<p>If the vector field $\dlvf$ is a {% intlink conservative_vector_field_introduction%}conservative vector field{%endintlink%} (also called a path-independent vector field), then the line integral
\begin{align*}
  \dlint
\end{align*}
does not depend on the actual path that $\dlc$ takes;
the integral depends only
on the beginning point (call it $\vc{p}$) and end point (call it
$\vc{q}$) of the curve $\dlc$.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, we have two curves $\dlc_1$ and $\dlc_2$ connecting
point $\vc{p}$ with point $\vc{q}$.</p>
<p class="centeredImage">{% image two_paths_between_points %}</p>
<p>Then we know that 
\begin{align*}
  \lint{\dlc_1}{\dlvf}
  =\lint{\dlc_2}{\dlvf}
  \label{eq:pathind}
\end{align*}
because $\dlvf$ is conservative.</p>

<p>Now, what would happen is we turned the path $\dlc_2$ around, so that it
starts at point $\vc{q}$ and ends at point $\vc{p}$?  (We will denote
this curve with the opposite {% intlink oriented_curve_definition %}orientation{%endintlink%} as $\dlc_2^-$.)  At any point, the tangent vector of $\dlc_2^-$ will
be the opposite of the tangent vector of $\dlc_2$ because the path is
going in the opposite direction.   Consequently
\begin{align*}
  \lint{\dlc_2^-}{\dlvf} = -\lint{\dlc_2}{\dlvf}.
  \label{eq:opposite}
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
If we define the curve $\dlc$ to be the curve $\dlc_1$ followed by the curve
$\dlc_2^-$, the path of $\dlc$ will start at the point $\vc{p}$, go to the point
$\vc{q}$ (via $\dlc_1$) and then return to the point $\vc{p}$ (via
$\dlc_2^-$).  In other words, the $\dlc$ will be a {% intlink closed_curve_definition %}closed{%endintlink%} curve.</p>
<p class="centeredImage">{% image closed_path_including_two_points %}</p>


<p>
The line integral over $\dlc$ is simply the line integral over $\dlc_1$
plus the line integral over $\dlc_2^-$.  By combining the above two equations,
we see these
these integrals are opposites
\begin{align*}
  \lint{\dlc_2^-}{\dlvf} = -\lint{\dlc_1}{\dlvf}.
\end{align*}
We conclude that the line integral over $\dlc$ is zero:
\begin{align*}
  \dlint = \lint{\dlc_1}{\dlvf} +
  \lint{\dlc_2^-}{\dlvf} =0. 
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
If $\dlc$ is a closed curve, we call the integral
\begin{align*}
  \dlint
\end{align*}
the {% intlink line_integral_circulation%}<i>circulation</i>{%endintlink%} of $\dlvf$ around $\dlc$.  If $\dlvf$
represents fluid flow, this integral indicates the tendancy for the
fluid to circulate around the curve $\dlc$.  We could use the above
argument to show that $\dlvf$ is conservative if and only if the
circulation around <i>any</i> closed curve is zero.</p>

<p>We can use this result as a {% intlink conservative_vector_field_determine test2 %}test for path-dependence{%endintlink%}.  If we can find
a single closed curve $\dlc$ where
\begin{align*}
  \dlint \ne 0,
\end{align*}
then we know that $\dlvf$ is path-dependent.  For the example vector
field $\dlvf(x,y) = (y, -x)$ shown at the end of the
{% intlink conservative_vector_field_introduction %}introduction to conservative fields{%endintlink%}, one can see the nonzero
circulation around any circular path centered at the origin.  This
observation is enough to conclude that $\dlvf$ is path-dependent.
</p>

<p>
The key point to remember is that path-independence means there is no
circulation around any closed curve.</p>
