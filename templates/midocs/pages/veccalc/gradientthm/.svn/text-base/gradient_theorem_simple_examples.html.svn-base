{% title "A simple example of using the gradient theorem" %}
{% description "An example of using the gradient theorem to calculate the line integral of a conservative, or path-independent, vector field." %}

<p>If a vector field $\dlvf$ is a {% intlink gradient_theorem_line_integrals %}gradient field{%endintlink%}, meaning $\dlvf = \nabla
f$ for some scalar-valued function $f$, then we can compute the
line integral of $\dlvf$ along a curve $\dlc$ from some point $\vc{a}$
to some other point $\vc{b}$ as
\begin{align*}
  \dlint = f(\vc{b}) - f(\vc{a}).
\end{align*}
This integral does not depend on the entire curve $\dlc$; it
depends on only the endpoints $\vc{a}$ and $\vc{b}$.  If we
replaced $\dlc$ by another curve with the same endpoints, the integral
would be unchanged.  Hence $\dlvf$ is {% intlink conservative_vector_field_introduction %}conservative{%endintlink%} (also called path-independent).</p>

<p>As an example, consider $f(x,y) = xy^2$, and let $\dlvf(x,y) = \nabla
f(x,y) = (y^2, 2xy)$.  Since we wrote $\dlvf$ as a gradient, we know that $\dlvf$
{% intlink conservative_vector_field_determine test1 %}must be conservative{%endintlink%}.</p>

<p>What is $\dlint$ where $\dlc$ is the path
$\dllp(t)=(t^2,2(t-2)^3)$ for $1 \le t \le 3$?
The starting point is $\vc{a} = \dllp(1) = (1,-2)$, and the
ending pont is $\vc{b} = \dllp(3) = (9,2)$.  Hence the integral must be
\begin{align*}
  \dlint &amp;= f(9,2) - f(1,-2)\\
  &amp;= 9(2^2) - 1(-2)^2 = 36-4=32.
\end{align*}</p>

<p>We could also compute $\dlint$ the direct way using the
parametrization $\dllp(t)$.  The integral isn't difficult as it is just a polynomial, but it is messy, so we'll skip the details.
\begin{align*}
  \dlint &amp;= \plint{a}{b}{\dlvf}{\dllp}\\
  &amp;= \int_1^3 \dlvf(t^2,2(t-2)^3) \cdot (2t, 6(t-2)^2) dt\\
  &amp;= \int_1^3 ((2(t-2)^3)^2 , 2t^22(t-2)^3)\cdot
  (2t,6(t-2)^2) dt\\
  &amp;=\int_1^3 8(t(t-2)^6+3t^2(t-2)^5)dt\\
  &amp;=8 (32 t^2 - 96 t^3 + 120 t^4 - 80 t^5 + 30 t^6 - 6 t^7 + t^8/2) \bigg|_1^3\\
  &amp;= 36-4 = 32,
\end{align*}
which agrees with the first answer.</p>

<p>We should get the same answer for any path from $(1,-2)$ to $(9,2)$.
Since $(9,2)-(1,-2) = (8,4)$, we let the curve $\adlc$ be the straight
line path parametrized by $\adllp(t) = (1,-2) + t(8,4) = (1+8t, 4t-2)$
for $0 \le t \le 1$.  This change is not a {% intlink line_integral_independent_parametrization %}reparametrization{%endintlink%} of
$\dlc$. The curve $\dlc$ was not a straight line, so $\adlc$ is a
completely different curve, as you can see in the below figure, where $\dlc$ is shown in blue and $\adlc$ is shown in green.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image gradient_theorem_example_curves %}</p>

<p>The integral along $\adlc$ is
\begin{align*}
  \lint{\adlc}{\dlvf}  &amp;= \plint{0}{1}{\dlvf}{\adllp}\\
  &amp;= \int_0^1 \dlvf(1+8t, 4t-2) \cdot (8,4) dt\\
  &amp;= \int_0^1 \left((4t-2)^2, 2(4t-2)(1+8t)\right) \cdot (8,4) dt\\
  &amp;= \int_0^1 (4-16t + 16t^2, -4 - 24 t + 64 t^2) \cdot (8,4) dt\\
  &amp;= \int_0^1 16(1 - 14 t + 24 t^2)dt\\
  &amp;= 16(t - 7 t^2 + 8 t^3)\bigg|_0^1 = 32.
\end{align*}
Indeed, we got the same answer again.</p>

<p>In this example, we were given the potential function at the outset,
making the application of the {% intlink gradient_theorem_line_integrals%}gradient
theorem{%endintlink%} particularly easy.
If you aren't given the potential function, then to apply the gradient theorem,
you'd need to {% intlink conservative_vector_field_determine%}test if the
vector field is conservative{%endintlink%} and then 
{%intlink conservative_vector_field_find_potential%}find the potential
function{%endintlink%}.</p>
