{% description "A introduction to the gradient theorem for conservative or path-independent line integrals." %}

<p>In one-variable calculus, the fundamental theorem of 
calculus was a useful tool for evaluating integrals.
If you are integrating a function $g(t)$ and it turns out that the function is the 
derivative of another function $g(t)=G'(t)$, then integrating
the function $g(t)$ is simple. 
The integral of $g$ is just the difference in the values of $G(t)$ at the endpoints.  We could write the result as
\begin{gather}
  \int_a^b G'(t) dt = G(b)-G(a).\label{onevarfund}
\end{gather}
</p>

<p>For line integrals of vector fields, there is a similar fundamental theorem.  
In some cases, we can reduce the line integral of a vector field $\dlvf$ 
along a curve $\dlc$ to the difference in the values of another function $f$ evaluated at the endpoints of $\dlc$,
\begin{gather}
\dlint = f(Q)-f(P),\label{onlyendpoints}
\end{gather}
where $\dlc$ starts at the point $P$ and ends at the point $Q$.
If we let $\dlvf: \R^n  \to \R^n$ {% confusedlink "function_notation" %} be a $n$-dimensional vector field,
then it must be that $f: \R^n \to \R$ is a scalar-valued function, as the
line integral evaluates to a single number.</p>

<p>This sounds good, but there is an important catch: it will only work for integrating
specials kinds of vector fields.  
Clearly, equation \eqref{onlyendpoints}
could possibly be true only if the line integral along $\dlc$ 
depends only on the endpoints of $\dlc$ and doesn't depend on the particular
path the $\dlc$ takes. 
In other words, we can hope for a similar fundamental theorem for
line integrals only if the vector field is 
{% intlink "conservative_vector_field_introduction" %}conservative{%endintlink%}
(also called path-independent).  
If the vector field $\dlvf$ is {% intlink "conservative_vector_field_introduction" anchor="pathdependent" %}path-dependent{%endintlink%},
then it will be impossible to reduce its line integral to values of a
function at the path endpoints.</p>

<p>We can easily derive what a conservative vector field should look like 
and in the process obtain our fundamental theorem for line integrals.
Let the curve $\dlc$ from point $P$ to $Q$ be parametrized by $\dllp(t)$
for $a < t < b$.  This means $P=\dllp(a)$, $Q=\dllp(b)$, and the line integral 
$\dlint$ can be written as $\dplint$.  
The desired relaationship between $\dlvf$ and $f$ described by 
equation \eqref{onlyendpoints} can
be rewritten as
\begin{gather}
\dplint = f(\dllp(b))-f(\dllp(a)). \label{withparam}
\end{gather}
</p>

<p>In this form, 
equation \eqref{withparam} is starting to look like our original 
equation \eqref{onevarfund}
for the fundamental theorem of calculus.
If we let $G(t) = f(\dllp(t))$, then the right hand side of 
equation \eqref{withparam}
is indeed $G(b)-G(a)$.  For 
equation \eqref{withparam}
to be valid, we just need $\dlvf(\dllp(t))\cdot \dllp'(t)$
to be equal to $G'(t)$.
</p>

<p>Since $G(t) = f(\dllp(t))$ is a composition of functions,
we can compute its derivative using the
{% intlink "chain_rule_multivariable_introduction" %}chain rule{%endintlink%}.
For $\dllp: \R  \to \R^n$ and $f: \R^n \to \R$, the {% intlink "chain_rule_multivariable_special_cases" anchor="inneronevariable" %}chain rule can be
written{%endintlink%} as
\begin{gather*}
  G'(t) = Df(\dllp(t)) D\dllp(t) = \nabla f(\dllp(t)) \cdot \dllp'(t).
\end{gather*}
The 
{% intlink "gradient_vector" %}gradient vector{%endintlink%}
$\nabla f$
is just the vector form of the $1 \times n$ 
{% intlink "derivative_matrix" %}derivative matrix{%endintlink%} $Df$, 
and the {% intlink "parametrized_curve_derivative" %}derivative of
a parametrized curve{%endintlink%} is the tangent vector $\dllp'(t)$.</p>

<p>We're in luck!  The expression for $G'(t)$ is in exactly the form
we need.  $G'(t)$ will be equal to  $\dlvf(\dllp(t))\cdot \dllp'(t)$
under the condition that we find a function $f$ 
so that the vector field $\dlvf$ is the gradient
$\nabla f$.  Let's assume that $\dlvf=\nabla f$.
Then, finally, by the one-variable fundamental theorem of calculus of
equation \eqref{onevarfund},
we know that the desired relationship of 
equation \eqref{withparam}
is valid in the form
\begin{gather*}
  \plint{a}{b}{\nabla f}{\dllp}= f(\dllp(b))-f(\dllp(a)).
\end{gather*}
</p>

<p>Rewriting this expression in terms of the original curve $\dlc$ 
from point $P$ to point $Q$, we obtain the 
<b>gradient theorem for line integrals:</b>
\begin{gather}
  \lint{\dlc}{\nabla f} = f(Q)-f(P).\label{gradienttheorem}
\end{gather}
This theorem is also called the <b>fundamental theorem for line integrals</b>,
as it is a generalization of the one variable 
fundamental theorem of calculus of
equation \eqref{onevarfund}
to line integrals along a curve.</p>

<h4>How to use the gradient theorem</h4>

<p>The gradient theorem makes evaluating line integrals $\dlint$ very simple, 
if we happen to know that $\dlvf=\nabla f$.  The function $f$ is called
the <i>potential function</i> of $\dlvf$.  
Typically, though you just have the vector field $\dlvf$, 
and the trick is to know if a potential function exists and, if so,
how find it.</p>

<p>It is clear from the above function that a vector field has a potential
function only if it is {% intlink "conservative_vector_field_introduction" anchor="pathdependent" %}conservative (or path-independent){%endintlink%}. 
It turns out the converse is true as well, so that a potential function $f$
exists satisfying $\nabla f = \dlvf$ if and only if $\dlvf$ is conservative.
So, the two steps for using the gradient theorem to evaluate a line integral $\dlint$ are
</p>
<ol>
  <li>{% intlink "conservative_vector_field_determine" %}determine if $\dlvf$ is conservative{%endintlink%}, and</li>
  <li>{% intlink "conservative_vector_field_find_potential" %}find the potential function $f${%endintlink%} if $\dlvf$ is conservative.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the potential function $f$ in hand, evaluating $\dlint$ is as 
simple as calculating the values of $f$ at the endpoints of $\dlc$ and
subtracting, according to the gradient theorem of 
equation \eqref{gradienttheorem}.
wThis final step is illustrated by {% intlink "gradient_theorem_simple_examples" %}a 
simple example{%endintlink%}.

<h4>Transform integrals to boundaries</h4>

<p>The fundamental theorem of calculus transformed the integral 
of the derivative $G'(t)$ along an interval $[a,b]$
to values of the function $G(t)$ at the endpoints $t=a$ and $t=b$.
This feature of transforming the integral of a function's derivative
over some set into function values at the boundary unites all four
{% intlink "fundamental_theorems_vector_calculus_summary" %}fundamental
theorems of vector calculus{%endintlink%}.
This parallel is very obvious for the gradient theorem,
as it equates the integral of a gradient $\nabla f$
over a curve to the function values at the endpoints of the curve.
</p>

<p>The other three fundamental theorems do the same transformation.
The difference is that the boundaries of the sets are more complicated,
so the &ldquo;function values at the boundary&rdquo; are actually
integrals of the function along the boundary.  
{% intlink "greens_theorem_idea" %}Green's theorem{%endintlink%} and
{% intlink "stokes_theorem_idea" %}Stokes' theorem{%endintlink%}
convert integrals of one type of derivative (the curl) of a vector field
to the values of the vector field along the boundary.  
Since the boundary is a curve, the evaluation of the  vector field function along
the boundary is a line integral. 
The {% intlink "divergence_theorem_idea" %}divergence theorem{%endintlink%}
converts integrals of another type of derivative (the divergence)
of a vector field to values of the vector field along the boundary.
Since the boundary is a surface, 
the evaluation of the  vector field function along
the boundary is a surface integral.</p>
