<p>A {% intlink "conservative_vector_field_introduction" %}conservative vector 
field{%endintlink%} (also called a path-independent vector field)
is a vector field $\dlvf$ whose line integral $\dlint$ over any 
curve $\dlc$ depends only on the endpoints of $\dlc$.
The integral is independent of the path that $\dlc$ takes going 
from its starting point to its ending point.  The below applet
illustrates the two-dimensional conservative vector field $\dlvf(x,y)=(x,y)$. </p>

{% boxedapplet "line_integral_conservative_vector_field_multiple" %}

<p>What are some ways to determine if a vector field is conservative?
Directly checking to see if a line integral doesn't depend on the path
is obviously impossible, as you would have to check an infinite number of paths 
between any pair of points.  But, if you found two paths that gave
different values of the integral, you could conclude the vector field 
was path-dependent.</p>

<p>Here are some options that could be useful under different circumstances.</p>
<ol>

  <li><p>{% navigation_tag "test1" "Tests" "Test 1" %}As mentioned in the context of the {% intlink "gradient_theorem_line_integrals" %}gradient theorem{%endintlink%}, 
      a vector field $\dlvf$ is conservative if and only if it has a potential
      function $f$ with $\dlvf = \nabla f$.  
      Therefore, if you are given a potential function $f$ or if you 
      can find one, and that potential function is defined everywhere,
      then there is nothing more to do.  You know
      that $\dlvf$ is a conservative vector field, and you don't need to 
      worry about the other tests we mention here.
      Similarly, if you can demonstrate that it is impossible to find
      a function $f$ that satisfies $\dlvf = \nabla f$, then you can
      likewise conclude that $\dlvf$ is non-conservative, or path-dependent.</p>
    <p>For this reason, you could skip this discussion about testing
      for path-dependence and go directly to the procedure for
      {% intlink "conservative_vector_field_find_potential" %}finding
      the potential function{%endintlink%}.  If this procedure works
      or if it breaks down, you've found your answer as to whether or
      not $\dlvf$ is conservative.  
      However, if you are like many of us and are prone to make a 
      mistake or two in a multi-step procedure, you'd probably
      benefit from other tests that could quickly determine 
      path-independence.  That way, you could avoid looking for
      a potential function when it doesn't exist and benefit
      from tests that confirm your calculations.
      </p></li>
 
  <li><p>{% navigation_tag "test2" "Tests" "Test 2"%}Another possible test involves the link between 
      {% intlink "conservative_vector_field_introduction" %}path-independence{%endintlink%}
      and {% intlink "line_integral_circulation" %}circulation{%endintlink%}. 
      One can show that a conservative vector field $\dlvf$ 
      {% intlink "conservative_vector_field_no_circulation" %}will have no circulation{%endintlink%} around any closed curve $\dlc$,
      meaning that its integral $\dlint$ around $\dlc$
      must be zero.  If you could somehow show that $\dlint=0$ for 
      every closed curve (difficult since there are an infinite number of these),
      then you could conclude that $\dlvf$ is conservative. 
      Or, if you can find one closed curve where the integral is non-zero,
      then you've shown that it is path-dependent. </p>
    
    <p>Although checking for circulation may not be a practical test for
      path-independence, the fact that path-independence
      implies no circulation around any closed curve is a central
      to what it means for a vector field to be conservative.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li><p>{% navigation_tag "test3" "Tests" "Test 3"%}If $\dlvf$ is a three-dimensional
      vector field, $\dlvf : \R^3 \to \R^3$ {% confusedlink "function_notation" %}, then we can derive another
      condition.
      This condition is based on the fact that a vector field $\dlvf$
      is conservative if and only if $\dlvf = \nabla f$
      for some potential function.  
      We can calculate that
      {% intlink "curl_gradient_zero" %}the curl of a gradient 
      is zero{%endintlink%}, $\curl \nabla f = \vc{0}$, for any
      twice continuously differentiable $f : \R^3 \to \R$.
      Therefore, if $\dlvf$ is conservative, then its curl must be zero, as
      $\curl \dlvf = \curl \nabla f = \vc{0}$.</p>
    
    <p>For a continuously differentiable two-dimensional vector field, $\dlvf : \R^2 \to \R^2$, 
      we can similarly conclude that if the vector field is conservative,
      then the scalar curl must be zero,
      $$ \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x}-\pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}
      = \frac{\partial f^2}{\partial x \partial y}
-\frac{\partial f^2}{\partial y \partial x}
=0.$$</p>
      

    <p>We have to be careful here.  The valid statement is that if $\dlvf$ 
      is conservative, then its curl must be zero.
      Without additional conditions on the vector field, the converse may not 
      be true, so we <b>cannot</b> conclude that $\dlvf$ is 
      conservative just from its curl being zero.
      There are {% intlink "path_dependent_zero_curl" %}path-dependent vector fields 
      with zero curl{%endintlink%}.
      On the other hand, we can conclude that if the curl of $\dlvf$ is non-zero, then $\dlvf$ must
      be path-dependent.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>{% navigation_tag "test4" "Tests" "Test 4"%}Can we obtain another test that allows us to determine for sure that
      a vector field is conservative?  
      We can by linking the previous two tests (tests 2 and 3). 
      Test 2 states that the lack of &ldquo;macroscopic circulation&rdquo;
      is sufficient to determine path-independence, but the problem
      is that lack of circulation around any closed curve is difficult
      to check directly.
      Test 3 says that a conservative vector field has no
      &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo; as captured by the
      {% intlink "curl_idea" %}curl{%endintlink%}.
      It's easy to test for lack of curl, but the problem is that 
      lack of curl is not sufficient to determine path-independence.</p>

    <p>What we need way to link the definite test of zero
      &ldquo;macroscopic circulation&rdquo; with the easy-to-check
      test of zero &ldquo;microscopic circulation.&rdquo;
      This link is exactly what both 
      {% intlink "greens_theorem_idea" %}Green's theorem{%endintlink%} and 
      {% intlink "stokes_theorem_idea" %}Stokes' theorem{%endintlink%} provide.
      Don't worry if you haven't learned both these theorems yet. 
      The basic idea is simple enough: the &ldquo;macroscopic circulation&rdquo;
      around a closed curve is equal to the total 
      &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo; in the planar
      region inside the curve (for two dimensions, Green's theorem)
      or in a surface whose boundary is the curve (for three dimensions,
      Stokes' theorem).</p>
      
    <p>Let's examine the case of a two-dimensional vector field whose
      scalar curl $\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x}-\pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}$ is zero.
      If we have a closed curve $\dlc$ where $\dlvf$ is defined everywhere
      inside it, then we can apply Green's theorem to conclude that
      the &ldquo;macroscopic circulation&rdquo; $\dlint$ around $\dlc$
      is equal to the total &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo;
      inside $\dlc$.  We can indeed conclude that the 
      &ldquo;macroscopic circulation&rdquo; is zero from the fact that
      the  &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo;
      $\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x}-\pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}$ is zero
      everywhere inside $\dlc$.</p>
    
    <p class="centeredImage">{% image "macroscopic_microscopic_circulation" %}</p>
    
    <p>According to test 2, to conclude that $\dlvf$ is conservative,
      we need $\dlint$ to be zero around <i>every</i> closed curve $\dlc$.
      If the vector field is defined inside every closed curve $\dlc$
      and the &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo; is zero everywhere inside
      each curve,
      then Green's theorem gives us exactly that condition.
      We can conclude that $\dlint=0$ around every closed curve
      and the vector field is conservative.</p>

    <p>The only way we could 
      {% intlink "path_dependent_zero_curl" %}run into trouble{%endintlink%}
      is if there are some
      closed curves $\dlc$ where $\dlvf$ is not defined for some points
      inside the curve.  In other words, if the region where $\dlvf$ is defined has
      some holes in it, then we cannot apply Green's theorem for every
      closed curve $\dlc$.  In this case, we cannot be certain that zero 
      &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo; implies zero
      &ldquo;macroscopic circulation&rdquo; and hence path-independence.
      Such a hole in the domain of definition of $\dlvf$ was exactly
      what caused in the problem in our
      {% intlink "path_dependent_zero_curl" %}counterexample of
      a path-dependent field with zero curl{%endintlink%}.
    </p>

    <p>On the other hand, we know we are safe if the region where $\dlvf$ is defined is 
      <i>{% intlink "simply_connected_definition" %}simply connected{%endintlink%}</i>, i.e., the region has no holes through it.
      In this case, we know $\dlvf$ is defined inside every closed curve 
      $\dlc$ and nothing tricky can happen.
      We can summarize our test for path-dependence of two-dimensional
      vector fields as follows.</p>
    
    <p>If a vector field $\dlvf: \R^2 \to \R^2$ is continuously
      differentiable in a simply connected domain $\dlr \in \R^2$
      and its curl is zero, i.e., 
      $$\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x}-\pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}=0,$$
      everywhere in $\dlr$,
      then $\dlvf$ is conservative within the domain $\dlr$.
    </p>
    
    <p>It turns out the result for three-dimensions is essentially 
      the same. If a vector field $\dlvf: \R^3 \to \R^3$ is continuously
      differentiable in a simply connected domain $\dlv \in \R^3$
      and its curl is zero, i.e., $\curl \dlvf = \vc{0}$,
      everywhere in $\dlv$,
      then $\dlvf$ is conservative within the domain $\dlv$.
    </p>
 
    <p>One subtle difference between two and three dimensions
      is what it means for a region to be 
      {% intlink "simply_connected_definition" %}simply connected{%endintlink%}.
      Any hole in a two-dimensional domain is enough to make it 
      non-simply connected.  But, in three-dimensions, a simply-connected
      domain can have a hole in the center, as long as the hole doesn't go
      all the way through the domain, as illustrated in this figure.</p>

    <p class="centeredImage">{% image "simply_connected_3D" %}</p>

    <p>The reason a hole in the center of a domain is not a problem
      in three dimensions is that we have more room to move around in 3D. 
      If we have a curl-free vector field $\dlvf$ 
      (i.e., with no &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo;), we can use
      {% intlink "stokes_theorem_idea" %}Stokes' theorem{%endintlink%} 
      to infer the absence of 
      &ldquo;macroscopic circulation&rdquo; around any closed curve $\dlc$.
      To use Stokes' theorem, we just need to find a surface
      whose boundary is $\dlc$.  
      If the domain of $\dlvf$ is simply connected, 
      even if it has a hole that doesn't go all the way
      through the domain, we can always find such a surface.
      The surface can just go around any hole that's in the middle of
      the domain.  With such a surface along which $\curl \dlvf=\vc{0}$,
      we can use Stokes' theorem to show that the circulation $\dlint$
      around $\dlc$ is zero.  Since we can do this for any closed
      curve, we can conclude that $\dlvf$ is conservative.</p>

    <p>The flexiblity we have in three dimensions to find multiple
      surfaces whose boundary is a given closed curve is illustrated in this
      applet that we use to introduce 
      {% intlink "stokes_theorem_idea" %}Stokes' theorem{%endintlink%}.</p>
      

    {% boxedapplet "macroscopic_microscopic_circulation_three_dimensions" %}

    <p>Of course, if the region $\dlv$ is not simply connected, but has
      a hole going all the way through it, then $\curl \dlvf = \vc{0}$
      is not a sufficient condition for path-independence. 
      In this case, if $\dlc$ is a curve that goes around the hole,
      then we cannot find a surface that stays inside that domain
      whose boundary is $\dlc$.
      Without such a surface, we cannot use Stokes' theorem to conclude
      that the circulation around $\dlc$ is zero.</p>
