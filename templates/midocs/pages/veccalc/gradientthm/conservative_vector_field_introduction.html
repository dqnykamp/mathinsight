{% title "An introduction to conservative vector fields" %}
{% description "An introduction to the concept of path-independent or conservative vector fields, illustrated by interactive graphics." %}

<p>Many physical force fields (vector fields) that you are familiar with
are <i>conservative</i> vector fields.  The term comes from the fact
that some kind of energy is conserved by these force fields.  The
important consequence for us, though, is that as you move an object
from point $\vc{a}$ to point $\vc{b}$, the work performed by
a conservative force field does <b>not</b> depend on the path taken
from point $\vc{a}$ to point $\vc{b}$.  For this reason, we often
refer to such vector fields as <i>path-independent</i> vector
fields.  Path-independent and conservative are just two terms that
mean the same thing.</p>

<p>For example, imagine you have to carry a heavy box from your front
door to your bedroom upstairs.  Because of the gravity (which can be
viewed as a force field), you have to do work to carry the box up.</p>

<p>Here we mean the scientific definition of work, which is force times distance.  Although it may feel like work to
move the box from one room to another on the same floor, the actual
work done against gravity is zero.</p>

<p>Next, imagine that you have two stairways in your house: a gently
sloping front staircase, and a steep back staircase.  Since the
gravitational field is a conservative vector field, the work you must
do against gravity is exactly the same if you take the front or the
back staircase.  As long as the box starts in the same position and
ends in the same position, the total work is the same.  (In fact, if
you decided to first carry the box to your neighbor's house, then
carry it up and down your backyard tree, and then in your back door
before taking it upstairs, it wouldn't make a difference for this scientific definition of work.  The
net work you performed against gravity would be the same.)</p>

<p>The {%intlink line_integral_vector_field_introduction %}line integral of a vector field{%endintlink%} can be viewed as the total work
performed by the force field on an object moving along the path.
For the above gravity example, we discussed the work you
performed <b>against</b> the gravity field, which is exactly
opposite the work performed <b>by</b> the gravity field.  We'd need
to multiply the line integral by $-1$ to get the work you performed
against the gravity field, but that's a technical point we don't need
to worry much about.</p>

<p>The above discussion implies that if $\dlvf$ is a conservative vector
field, then the integral
\begin{align*}
  \dlint
\end{align*}
does not actually depend on the path $\dlc$.  It only depends on the
beginning point (say $\vc{a}$) and endpoint (say $\vc{b}$) of the path
$\dlc$.  If we changed the path $\dlc$ to a different path $\adlc$, then we
know that
\begin{align*}
  \dlint = \lint{\adlc}{\dlvf}
\end{align*}
as long as the path $\adlc$ also starts at the point $\vc{a}$ and ends at
the point $\vc{b}$.  This property is certainly not true for all
vector fields $\dlvf$ (as shown below).  It is only true for the
special class of conservative vector fields,
which is why we can call them path-independent vector fields. </p>

<p>The vector field $\dlvf(x,y)=(x,y)$ is a conservative vector
field.  (You can read how to {% intlink conservative_vector_field_determine %}test for path-independence{%endintlink%} later.
For now, take it on faith.)  It is illustrated by the black arrows in
the below figure.  We want to compute the integral 
\begin{align*}
  \dlint
\end{align*}
where $\dlc$ is a path from the point $\vc{a}=(3,-3)$ (shown by the
cyan square) to the point $\vc{b}=(2,4)$ (shown by the magenta
square).  Since $\dlvf$ is path-independent, we don't need to know
anything else about the path $\dlc$ to compute the line integral.
Later, you'll {% intlink gradient_theorem_line_integrals%}learn to compute{%endintlink%} that the value of the integral is 1, as
shown by the magenta line on the slider below the figure.</p>

{% boxedapplet "line_integral_conservative_vector_field" %}


<p>The below applet demonstrate the path-independence of $\dlvf$,
as one can see that the integrals along three different paths give the
same value.  The vector field appears to be path-independent, as promised.  (You'd have to check all
the infinite number of possible paths from all points $\vc{a}$ to all
points $\vc{b}$ to determine that $\dlvf$ was really
path-independent.  Fortunately, you'll {% intlink conservative_vector_field_determine %}learn some simpler methods{%endintlink%}.)</p>

{% boxedapplet "line_integral_conservative_vector_field_multiple" %}

<p>Of course, the line integrals to intermediate points can vary widely.
By comparing the tangent vectors of the curves to the vector field, you should be able to
explain the behavior of the line integrals to intermediate points.  In
particular, you can determine why the line integral increases or
decreases by comparing the direction of motion along the path to the
direction of the vector field.</p>

<h4>A path-dependent vector field</h4>

<p>As mentioned above, not all vector fields are conservative.  If a
vector field is not path-independent, we call it path-dependent (or non-conservative). The
vector field $\dlvf(x,y) = (y, -x)$ is an example of a path-dependent
vector field.  This vector field
{%intlink vector_field_overview %}represents clockwise circulation around the origin{%endintlink%}.  It turns out, such circulation is
the {% intlink conservative_vector_field_no_circulation%}key indicator of path-dependence{%endintlink%} (however, the circulation may not
be as obvious as it is in this example). Again, you can {% intlink conservative_vector_field_no_circulation%}read the details{%endintlink%}
later.</p>

<p>
For a path-dependent vector field, the line
integral from $\vc{a}$ to $\vc{b}$ isn't defined until you specify a
path, as the value can depend on the details of the path.
The vector field $\dlvf(x,y) = (y, -x)$ and three paths from $\vc{a}=(0,-4)$
to $\vc{b}=(0,4)$ are shown in the below applet.
The three paths demonstrate that $\dlvf$ is indeed
path-dependent, as the three integrals from $\vc{a}$ to $\vc{b}$ have
different values.  Indeed, you only need to show that the integrals
along two paths from some point $\vc{a}$ to some other point $\vc{b}$
are not the same in order to prove that $\dlvf$ was path-dependent
(since if $\dlvf$ were path-independent, this could never happen).
 </p>


{% boxedapplet "line_integral_path_dependent_vector_field" %}

<p>Path $\dlc$ (in blue) is a straight line up the $y$-axis.  Along the
$y$-axis, $\dlvf(0,y)=(y,0)$ is horizontal.  Hence the direction of
motion and the vector field are orthogonal, and
\begin{align*}
  \dlint =0.
\end{align*}
On the other hand, path $\adlc$ (in green) goes with the clockwise
rotation of the vector field.  Consequently, the work performed by the
vector field is positive, and 
\begin{align*}
  \lint{\adlc}{\dlvf} >0.
\end{align*}
The same reasoning shows that
\begin{align*}
   \lint{\sadlc}{\dlvf}  <0,
\end{align*}
since the counterclockwise direction of path $\sadlc$ (in red) is opposite
the direction of the vector field.  Since all three paths start at
$\vc{a}$ and end at $\vc{b}$, these results confirm that $\dlvf$ is
path-dependent.</p>

<h4>Calculating integrals of conservative vector fields</h4>

<p>One of the four {% intlink fundamental_theorems_vector_calculus_summary %}fundamental
theorems of vector calculus{%endintlink%} is the 
{% intlink gradient_theorem_line_integrals %}gradient theorem for line integrals{%endintlink%},
which gives a nice way to calculate of line integral of conservative vector fields.
To use the gradient theorem, one needs to {% intlink conservative_vector_field_determine%}determine if a vector field is conservative{%endintlink%}.
If a vector field is conservative, one can {% intlink conservative_vector_field_find_potential %}find a potential function{%endintlink%} analogous to the potential
energy associated with conservative physical forces.
Once the potential function is known, it is very simple to calculate line integrals,
as shown by this {%intlink gradient_theorem_simple_examples %}example of calculating a line integral{%endintlink%} using the gradient theorem.</p>
