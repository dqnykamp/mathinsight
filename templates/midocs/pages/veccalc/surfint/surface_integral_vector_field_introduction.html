{% title "Introduction to a surface integral of a vector field" %}
{% description "How to define the integral of a vector field over a parametrized surface, illustrated by interactive graphics." %}

<p>The {%intlink line_integral_vector_field_introduction %}line integral of a vector field{%endintlink%} $\dlvf$ could be interpreted as the work
done by the force field $\dlvf$ on a particle moving along the path.
The surface integral of a vector field $\dlvf$ actually has a simpler
explanation.  If the vector field $\dlvf$ represents the 
{%intlink vector_field_fluid_flow%}flow of a fluid{%endintlink%},
then the surface integral of $\dlvf$ will represent the amount
of fluid flowing through the surface (per unit time).</p>

<p>The amount of the fluid flowing through the surface per unit time is
also called the <b>flux</b> of fluid through the surface.  For this
reason, we often call the surface integral of a vector field a
<b>flux integral</b>.</p>

<p>If water is flowing perpendicular to the surface, a lot of water will
flow through the surface and the flux will be large.  On the other
hand, if water is flowing parallel to the surface, water will not flow
through the surface, and the flux will be zero.  To calculate the
total amount of water flowing through the surface, we want to add up
the component of the vector $\dlvf$ that is perpendicular to the
surface.</p>

<p>Let $\vc{n}$ be a {%intlink parametrized_surface_normal_vector%}unit normal vector{%endintlink%} to the surface. 
The choice of normal vector {%intlink parametrized_surface_orient %}orients
the surface{%endintlink%} and determines the sign of the fluid flux.
The flux of fluid
through the surface is determined by the component of $\dlvf$ that is
in the direction of $\vc{n}$, i.e. by $\dlvf \cdot \vc{n}$. Note that $\dlvf \cdot \vc{n}$ will be zero if $\dlvf$ and $\vc{n}$ are
perpendicular, positive if $\dlvf$ and $\vc{n}$ are pointing the same
direction, and negative if $\dlvf$ and $\vc{n}$ are pointing in
opposite directions.  </p>

<p>Let's illustrate this with the function 
\begin{align*}
  \dlsp(\spfv,\spsv) = (\spfv\cos \spsv, \spfv\sin \spsv, \spsv).  
\end{align*}
that parametrizes a {% intlink parametrized_surface_introduction %}helicoid{%endintlink%}
for $(\spfv,\spsv) \in \dlr = [0,1] \times [0, 2\pi]$.
As shown in the following figure, we chose the upward point normal vector.
(We
could have used the downward point normal instead.  If we did, our
fluid flux calculation we have the opposite sign.)</p>

{% boxedapplet "parametrized_helicoid_normal_vector" %}

<p>Given some fluid flow $\dlvf$, if we integrate $\dlvf \cdot \vc{n}$,
we will determine the total flux of fluid through the helicoid,
counting flux in the direction of $\vc{n}$ as positive and flux in the
opposite direction as negative.</p>

<p>We represent the fluid flow vector field $\dlvf$ by magenta arrows in the following applet.</p>

{% boxedapplet "fluid_flow_oriented_helicoid" %}


<p>It appears that the fluid is flowing generally in the same direction
as $\vc{n}$ (for the most part $\dlvf$ and $\vc{n}$ are closer to
pointing in the same direction than pointing in the opposite
direction). However, notice, for example, that when $\spfv=0$ and $\spsv=2\pi$
(or when $\spfv=0$ and $\spsv=0$), the fluid is flowing in the opposite
direction of $\vc{n}$ (at least the flow is closer to the opposite
direction than the same direction).  At these points, the fluid is
crossing the surface in the opposite direction than it is at most
points on the surface.</p>

<p>The below figure demonstrates this more clearly.  Here, you can see
the fluid vector $\dlvf$ (in magenta) at the same point as the
normal vector (in blue).  The blue dot on the slider shows the dot
product $\dlvf \cdot \vc{n}$.  Note that $\dlvf \cdot \vc{n}$ is
usually positive, but is negative at a few points, such as those
mentioned above.  When $\dlvf \cdot \vc{n}=0$, what is the
relationship between the fluid vector $\dlvf$ and the surface?</p>

{% boxedapplet "fluid_flow_point_oriented_helicoid" %}

<p>The total flux of fluid flow through the surface $\dls$, denoted by 
$\dsint$, is the integral of the vector field $\dlvf$ over $\dls$.
The integral of the vector field $\dlvf$ is defined as the integral 
of the scalar function $\dlvf \cdot \vc{n}$ over $\dls$
\begin{align*}
  \text{Flux} &amp;= \dsint = \ssint{\dls}{\dlvf \cdot \vc{n}}.
\end{align*}
The formula for a {%intlink surface_integral_scalar_function_introduction%}surface integral of a scalar function{%endintlink%} over a surface $\dls$ parametrized by $\dlsp$ is
\begin{align*}
  \ssint{\dls}{f} = \iint_\dlr f(\dlsp(\spfv,\spsv))\left\| \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}(\spfv,\spsv) \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}(\spfv,\spsv)
  \right\|
  d\spfv\,d\spsv.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>Plugging in $f = \dlvf \cdot \vc{n}$, the total flux of the fluid is
\begin{align*}
   \dsint= \iint_\dlr (\dlvf \cdot \vc{n}) \left\| \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv} \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}
  \right\|
  d\spfv\,d\spsv.
\end{align*}</p>

<p>Lastly, the {% intlink parametrized_surface_normal_vector %}formula for a unit normal vector of the surface{%endintlink%} is
\begin{align*}
  \vc{n} = \frac{\displaystyle \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv} \times
  \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}}{\displaystyle \left\| \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv} \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}
  \right\|}.
\end{align*}
If we plug in this expression for $\vc{n}$, the $\left\|
  \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv} \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv} \right\|$
factors cancel, and we obtain the final expression for the surface integral:
\begin{align*}
    \dsint= \iint_\dlr \dlvf(\dlsp(\spfv,\spsv)) \cdot
  \left( \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}(\spfv,\spsv) \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}(\spfv,\spsv)
  \right)
  d\spfv\,d\spsv.
  \label{eq:surfvec}
\end{align*}</p>

<p>Note how the equation for a surface integral is similar to the equation for the
{%intlink line_integral_vector_field_introduction %}line integral of a vector field{%endintlink%}
\begin{align*}
  \dlint
  = \int_a^b \dlvf(\dllp(t)) \cdot \dllp'(t) dt.
\end{align*}
For line integrals, we integrate the component of the vector field in
the tangent direction given by $\dllp'(t)$.  For surface integrals,
we integrate the component of the vector field in the normal direction
given by $\pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}(\spfv,\spsv) \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}(\spfv,\spsv)$.</p>

{% intlink surface_integral_vector_examples %}examples{%endintlink%}
