{% title "Introduction to a surface integral of a scalar-valued function" %}
{% description "How to define the integral of a scalar-valued function over a parametrized surface." %}

<p>There are many parallels between
{% intlink parametrized_surface_introduction %}parametrized surfaces{%endintlink%}
and {%intlink parametrized_curve_introduction%}parametrized curves{%endintlink%}.
Both are parametrized by vector-valued functions, with the difference 
being the dimension of their inputs (one-dimensional $t$ for parametrized
curves and two-dimensional $(\spfv,\spsv)$ for parametrized surfaces).
Both have two possible orientations (oriented by choice of {%intlink parametrized_curve_orient %}tangent vector{%endintlink%} for curves and by choice of {%intlink parametrized_surface_orient %}normal vector{%endintlink%} for surfaces).
Both have integrals giving their measure ({%intlink parametrized_curve_arc_length %}arc length{%endintlink%} or {%intlink parametrized_surface_area%}area{%endintlink%})
in terms of derivatives of the parametrization that describe how the domain is stretched and shrunk as it is mapped onto the image.</p>

<p>In the same way, surface integrals are similar to {% intlink line_integral_scalar_function_introduction%}line integrals{%endintlink%}. 
Just as there are two types of integrals over curves
(line integrals of {% intlink line_integral_scalar_function_introduction%}scalar functions{%endintlink%} and of {% intlink line_integral_vector_field_introduction%}vector fields{%endintlink%})
there are two types of surface integrals:
surface integrals of scalar functions (discussed on this page) and 
{% intlink surface_integral_vector_field_introduction%}surface integrals of vector fields{%endintlink%}.
The surface integral of a scalar function is a simple generalization of a
{% intlink double_integral_introduction%}double integral{%endintlink%}.
Like the {% intlink line_integral_vector_field_introduction%}line integral of vector fields{%endintlink%}, the {% intlink surface_integral_vector_field_introduction%}surface integrals of vector fields{%endintlink%}
will play a big role in the fundamental theorems of vector calculus.

<p>Let $\dls$ be a surface parametrized by $\dlsp(\spfv,\spsv)$ for $(\spfv,\spsv)$ in some region $\dlr$. 
Imagine you wanted to calculate the mass of the surface given its density at each point $\vc{x}$ described by the scalar-valued function $f(\vc{x})$.
The mass will be the integral of the density over the surface
(just like the mass of a wire was the {%intlink line_integral_scalar_function_introduction%}integral of a density{%endintlink%} over the curve).</p>

<p>If the surface happened to be lying in the $xy$-plane rather than floating in
three-dimensional space, the situation would be identical to that of
{% intlink double_integral_change_variables_introduction%}changing variables
in double integrals{%endintlink%} (other than the region we call $\dlr$ here is called $\dlr^*$ in that context changing variables).  
We need only slight modifications for the case of a surface floating
in three dimensional space.</p>

<p>To calculate the mass, we integrate $f(\dlsp(\spfv,\spsv))$ as $(\spfv,\spsv)$ range over the domain $\dlr$.
In order to multiply the density $f$ by area on the surface
not by area in $\dlr$, 
we must account for any stretching or shrinking by $\dlsp$ as it
maps $\dlr$ onto the surface, as illustrated in the below applet.</p>

{% boxedapplet parametrized_helicoid_surface_area %}

<p>We already calculated the stretching or shrinking by $\dlsp$ when we 
calculated {%intlink parametrized_surface_area %}surface area{%endintlink%}.
The area of the region on the surface that is the image of a small $\Delta\spfv \times \Delta\spsv$ rectangle in $\dlr$ is
\begin{align*}
  \Delta A = \left\| \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}(\spfv,\spsv) \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}(\spfv,\spsv) \right\|
  \Delta \spsv \Delta \spsv.
\end{align*}
If we multiply
this by the density $f(\dlsp(\spfv,\spsv))$, we will obtain the mass of that
small section.  We could approximate the mass of the whole surface by
a Riemann sum of such terms.  Then, by letting $\Delta\spfv$ and $\Delta\spsv$ go to zero, we would discover that the mass of the whole surface is
the integral
\begin{align*}
  \ssint{\dls}{f} = \iint_\dlr f(\dlsp(\spfv,\spsv))\left\| \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}(\spfv,\spsv) \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}(\spfv,\spsv)
  \right\|
  d\spfv\,d\spsv.
\end{align*}
This integral is a two-dimensional analog of the
{%intlink line_integral_scalar_function_introduction%}line integral of a scalar-valued function{%endintlink%} except that $\|\dlsp'(t)\|$
is replaced by
\begin{align*}
    \left\| \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spfv}(\spfv,\spsv) \times \pdiff{\dlsp}{\spsv}(\spfv,\spsv)
  \right\|.
\end{align*}
