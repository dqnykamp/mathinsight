{% description "An alternative notation for the line integral of a vector field is introduced." %}


<p>In the {% intlink "line_integral_vector_field_introduction" %}introduction
to line integrals of vector fields{%endintlink%}, 
we denoted line integrals
\begin{align}
  \dlint = \dplint, 
  \label{original_notation}
\end{align}
for a curve $C$ parametrized by $\dllp(t)$ for $t \in [a,b]$.
Sometimes, we use an alternative notation for these line integrals, 
where we essential &ldquo;multiply out&rdquo; the dot products on both
sides of the equation.</p>

<p>Let's assume we are in three dimensions, though this notation can also be used for two dimensions.
We'll denote the components of the vector field as 
$\dlvf = (\dlvfc_1, \dlvfc_2, \dlvfc_3)$.
We can think of the $d\lis$ as being a vector of infinitesimals in all three 
coordinates and denote it  $d\lis = (dx,dy,dz)$.  
With this notational convention, we can rewrite the left hand side of
equation \eqref{original_notation}
so that it becomes
\begin{align*}
  \dlint= \int_\dlc \dlvfc_1 dx 
  +\dlvfc_2 dy + \dlvfc_3 dz.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>We can write the components of $\dllp$ as $\dllp(t) = (x(t),y(t),z(t))$
and its derivative as
\begin{align*}
  \dllp'(t) = \left( \diff{x}{t}, \diff{y}{t}, \diff{z}{t}\right).
\end{align*}
Multiplying out the dot product on the right hand side of
equation \eqref{original_notation},
we can rewwrite it as
\begin{align*}
  \dplint =
  \int_a^b \left(\dlvfc_1(\dllp(t)) \diff{x}{t} + \dlvfc_2(\dllp(t)) \diff{y}{t}
    + \dlvfc_3(\dllp(t)) \diff{z}{t}\right)dt.  
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>
Frequently, line integral problems are presented in this notation.  In
this case, one can compute them directly using the formula 
\begin{align}
  \int_\dlc \dlvfc_1 dx + \dlvfc_2 dy + \dlvfc_3 dz=
  \int_a^b \left(\dlvfc_1(\dllp(t)) \diff{x}{t} + \dlvfc_2(\dllp(t)) \diff{y}{t}
    + \dlvfc_3(\dllp(t)) \diff{z}{t}\right)dt.
  \label{alternative_formula}
\end{align}
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Evaluate 
\begin{align*}
  \int_\dlc y\,dx + (x+y) dy + dz  
\end{align*}
where thee curve $\dlc$ is parameterized by 
$\dllp(t)=(t, 1-t, 1)$, $0 \le t \le 1$.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b>: If we write $\dllp(t) = (t,1-t,1) = (x(t),y(t),z(t))$,  Then
$\diff{x}{t} = 1$, $\diff{y}{t} = -1$, and $\diff{z}{t} =0$.  Since
$\dlvfc_1(x,y,z) = y$, $\dlvfc_2(x,y,z) = x+y$, and
$\dlvfc_3(x,y,z) =1$, we can use the formula of
equation \eqref{alternative_formula}
to calculate the integral.
\begin{align*}
  &amp;\int_\dlc y\, dx + (x+y) dy\\
  &amp;= \int_0^1 \left(y(t) \diff{x}{t} + (x(t)+y(t))\diff{y}{t}
    + \diff{z}{t} \right)dt\\
  &amp;= \int_0^1 \left[(1-t)(1) + (t + (1-t)) (-1)\right] dt\\
  &amp;= \int_0^1 [(1 - t) + (-1)] dt\\
  &amp;= \int_0^1 (-t)dt = \left. - \frac{t^2}{2} \right|_0^1 = -\frac{1}{2}
\end{align*}
