{% title "Introduction to a line integral of a scalar-valued function" %}
{% description "Introduction with interactive graphics illustrating the line integral of a scalar-valued function and informally deriving the formula for calculating the integral from the parametrization of the curve." %}

<p>A <i>line integral</i> (sometimes called a path integral) of a
scalar-valued function can be thought of as a generalization
of the one-variable integral of a function over an interval,
where the interval can be shaped into a 
{% intlink "parametrized_curve_introduction" %}curve{%endintlink%}.
A simple analogy that captures the essence of a scalar line integral
is that of calculating the mass of a wire from its density.</p>

<p>If the density of a wire were constant, then one could calculate
its mass by multiplying the density by the 
{% intlink "parametrized_curve_arc_length" %}arc length{%endintlink%}
of the curve.
If, on the other hand, the density varies along the wire, 
one can use a procedure similar to 
{% intlink "parametrized_curve_arc_length" %}that
of calculating the  arc length{%endintlink%}
to derive a formula for the density.  
This formula defines of the line integral over the wire
of the function giving the density.</p>

<p>Extending the 
{% intlink "parametrized_curve_arc_length" %}slinky example{%endintlink%} 
used to introduce arc length,
we let one coil of the slinky be parametrized by 
$\dllp(t) = (\cos t, \sin t, t)$, for $0 \le t \le 2\pi$,
and imagine that the density of the slinky at the point $(x,y,z)$
is given by some function $\dlsi(x,y,z)$.
This function describes how the slinky might be thicker in some
parts and thinner in others. 
For a given value of $t$, a
point on the slinky is $\dllp(t)$, and the density of the slinky
at that point is
$\dlsi(\dllp(t))$, as illustrated below.</p>

{% boxedapplet "helix_variable_density" %}

<p>To calculate the mass of the slinky, we repeat the procedure we used
to {% intlink "parametrized_curve_arc_length" %}calculate its 
length{%endintlink%}.  We pretend the slinky is composed by a bunch of straight line segments.  Moreover, we assume each line segment has constant
density, so the mass of the line segment is simply its length times its
density.  We let the density of each line segment be the density of
the slinky at the point where the upper end of the
line segment
touches the slinky.  For a given discretization $\Delta t$, 
we estimate the mass of the slinky as the total
mass of the line segments (labeled as mass(dt)).</p>

{% boxedapplet "line_integral_helix_mass_density" %}

<p>We can increase the number of line segments (decreasing the length of
each line segment) so that the total mass of the line segments becomes
a better estimate of the slinky mass.  As the discretization size $\Delta t$
approaches zero, the length of each line segment shrinks toward
zero, the number of line segments increases, and the density of each
line segment more closely approximates the density of the slinky.
Since the total length of the line segments approaches the slinky
length, the total mass of the line segments approaches the mass of the
slinky.</p>

<p>The derivation of the line integral formula is similar to
the procedure we used to estimate the
{% intlink "parametrized_curve_arc_length" %}slinky length{%endintlink%}.
The length of the $i$th line segment can be written as
$\|\dllp(t_i) - \dllp(t_{i-1})\|$.  The density of the line segment is
simply $\dlsi(\dllp(t_i))$ since $\dllp(t_i)$ is the point where the
upper end of the line segment touches the slinky. The
mass of the line segment is its density times its length:
$\dlsi(\dllp(t_i))\|\dllp(t_i) - \dllp(t_{i-1})\|$.  
We obtain the total mass of the line segments by
summing over all $n$ line segments:
\begin{align*}
  \sum_i^n \dlsi(\dllp(t_i)) \| \dllp(t_i) - \dllp(t_{i-1})\|.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>The only difference between the above expression and the one
we obtained for
{% intlink "parametrized_curve_arc_length" %}arc length calculation{%endintlink%}
is the $\dlsi(\dllp(t_i))$ factor.  
To turn this into an integral, we repeat the same steps we did on that page.
We again let $\Delta t_i = t_i - t_{i-1}$, multiply and divide each 
term by $\Delta t_i$, and obtain the more complicated looking expression.
\begin{align*}
  \sum_i^n \dlsi(\dllp(t_i))\| \dllp(t_i) - \dllp(t_{i-1})\|
  &amp;=  \sum_i^n\dlsi(\dllp(t_i))
  \left\| \frac{\dllp(t_{i-1} + \Delta t_i) - \dllp(t_{i-1})}{\Delta t_i}\right\|
  \Delta t_i.
\end{align*}
Since the ugly expression in the $\| \cdot \|$ is the quantity in
{% intlink "parametrized_curve_derivative" anchor="limit_definition" %}limit 
definition of the derivative{%endintlink%} of $\dllp(t)$, 
when we let $\Delta t_i \to 0$ and $n \to \infty$, the above Riemann 
sum converges to the integral
\begin{align*}
  \int_a^b \dlsi(\dllp(t))\| \dllp\,'(t) \| dt,
\end{align*}
where $a=0$ and $b=2\pi$.  This is called the line integral of $\dlsi$
over the curve parametrized by $\dllp$.</p>


<p>We often use $\als(t)$ to be the length of the slinky from the
beginning point $\dllp(a)$ up to the point $\dllp(t)$.  If you think
of $d\als$ as being the length of a tiny line segment approximating
the slinky, then the mass of that tiny line segment is $\dlsi$ times
$d\als$.  For this reason, we often denote the integral representing
the mass of the slinky as
\begin{align*}
  \slint{\dllp}{\dlsi} =\int_a^b \dlsi(\dllp(t))\| \dllp\,'(t) \| dt.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>The notation $\slint{\dllp}{\dlsi}$ indicates that the integral
of $\dlsi$ is over the parametrized curve $\dllp$.
But, if the integral can really represent the mass of a wire
with density $\dlsi$, then the mass should not depend on how we
chose to parametrize the wire.  
In fact, it does not, and you can read about how the line integral
is {% intlink "line_integral_independent_parametrization" %}independent
of the parametrization{%endintlink%} used to represent the curve.</p>

<p>You can also read some {% intlink "line_integral_scalar_examples" %}examples{%endintlink%}
of calculating line integrals of scalar functions.</p>
