{% description "Description of how the value of a line integral over a curve is independent of the parametrization of the curve." %}

<p>In the {% intlink "line_integral_scalar_function_introduction" %}introduction
to scalar line integrals{%endintlink%},
we derived the formula for $\slint{\dllp}{\dlsi}$, 
the line integral of a function $f$ over
a curve parametrized by $\dllp(t)$ for $a \le t \le b$:
\begin{align*}
  \slint{\dllp}{\dlsi} =\int_a^b \dlsi(\dllp(t))\| \dllp\,'(t) \| dt.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>However, the value of this integral should not depend on the 
specific parametrization $\dllp$, as it is designed to capture quantities
like the total mass of a wire with density $\dlsi$.  
The integral should only depend on the density function $\dlsi(\vc{x})$ and
the image curve, denoted by $\dlc$, which is the set of points
$\dllp(t)$ for all values of $t$ in the interval $[a,b]$.</p>

<p>For the reason, we can think of the line integral as being over the curve $\dlc$, rather than
the particular parametrization given by $\dllp(t)$.  To reflect this
viewpoint, we could write the integral that gives the mass of the
slinky as
\begin{align*}
  \dslint =  \pslint{a}{b}{\dlsi}{\dllp},
\end{align*}
where the only difference from above is that we replaced $\dllp$ with $\dlc$.
</p>


<p>
The notation $\dslint$ makes it explicit that line integrals
are independent of the
parametrization $\dllp(t)$ (after all, the notation does not mention
$\dllp(t)$).  You may remember that the same curve $\dlc$ can be
parametrized by many functions.  For example, we gave
{% intlink "parametrized_curve_derivative_location_velocity" %}two 
different parametrizations of the unit circle{%endintlink%}.
Above, we parametrized the
slinky by $\dllp(t) = (\cos t, \sin t, t)$, for $0 \le t \le 2\pi$.
We could have equally well parametrized the same slinky by $\adllp(t)
= (\cos 2t, \sin 2t, 2t)$ for $0 \le t \le \pi$.  (If $\dllp(t)$ and
$\adllp(t)$ were the positions at time $t$ of two particles traveling
along the slinky, the particle given by $\adllp(t)$ travels twice as
fast, covering the slinky in half the time, compared to the particle
given by $\dllp(t)$.)  
</p>

<p>As long as the density $\dlsi(\vc{x})$ is
unchanged, the mass of the slinky had better be the same, no matter
which parametrization we use.  Hence, it must be true that the mass is
both
\begin{align*}
  \dslint = \int_{\dllp} \dlsi \, d\als = \pslint{0}{2\pi}{\dlsi}{\dllp} 
\end{align*}
and 
\begin{align*}
  \dslint = \int_{\adllp} \dlsi \, d\als = \pslint{0}{\pi}{\dlsi}{\adllp}.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>Can you see why the integral is the same for both parametrizations
$\dllp(t)$ and $\adllp(t)$, i.e., why
\begin{align*}
\pslint{0}{2\pi}{\dlsi}{\dllp} = \pslint{0}{\pi}{\dlsi}{\adllp}?
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>In the first case, you are integrating over an interval that is twice
as long (from 0 to $2\pi$ versus from 0 to $\pi$), but the speed $\|
\dllp'(t)\|$ is half the speed $\| \adllp'(t) \|$.  The two effects cancel
and the integrals are equal.</p>

<p>
Since the {% intlink "line_integral_vector_field_introduction" %}line integral 
of a vector field{%endintlink%} $\dlvf$ over the curve is based on 
the line integral of a scalar function $f = \dlvf \cdot \vc{T}$,
where $\vc{T}$ is the unit tangent vector of the curve, we expect that 
line integrals of vector fields should also be independent of the
parametrization $\dllp(t)$.  Indeed, this is the case, with one 
important exception.  Since $\vc{T} = \dllp'(t)/\dllp(t)$, the unit
tangent vector, and hence the integral $\dlint$, will be independent
of the speed $\|\dllp'(t)\|$ of the parametrization.  The unit tangent 
vector, as its name implies will always be of length 1.  
But, at any point along the curve, there are two
unit tangent vectors pointing in opposite directions.  If we call
one of them $\vc{T}$, then the other is $-\vc{T}$.
The choice of these unit tangent vectors will depend on the direction
that $\dllp(t)$ transverses the curve $\dlc$ as $t$ increases.
</p>

<p>We refer to the choice of the unit tangent vector, or equivalently,
the choice of the direction to tranverse $\dlc$, as the
{% intlink "parametrized_curve_orient" %}orientation{%endintlink%} of the curve.
Every {% intlink "simple_curve_definition" %}simple{%endintlink%}
curve has two orientations, one corresponding to one unit tangent vector
$\vc{T}$ and the other corresponding to its opposite $-\vc{T}$.
Scalar line integrals are independent of curve orientation, 
but vector line integrals will switch sign if you switch the orientation of the
curve. This make sense intuitively, as the mass of the slinky 
shouldn't change, but the work done by a force field changes sign if you
move in the opposite direction.
</p>


<p>The examples of line integrals of {% intlink "line_integral_scalar_examples" %}scalar functions{%endintlink%} and {% intlink "line_integral_vector_examples" %}vector fields{%endintlink%} include calculations of the same line integral with different parametrizations.</p>
