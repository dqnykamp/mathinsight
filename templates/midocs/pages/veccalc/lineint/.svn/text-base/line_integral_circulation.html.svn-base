{% description "Definition of circulation as the line integral of a vector field around a closed curve." %}

<p>The {%intlink line_integral_vector_field_introduction%}vector line integral introduction{%endintlink%} 
explains how the line integral $\dlint$ of a vector field
$\dlvf$ over an oriented curve $\dlc$ &ldquo;adds up&rdquo; the component of the
vector field that is tangent to the curve.  In this sense, the
line integral measures how much the vector field is aligned with the
curve.  If the curve $\dlc$ is a {% intlink closed_curve_definition %}closed curve{%endintlink%}, then the line integral
indicates how much the vector field tends to circulate around the
curve $\dlc$.  In fact, for an  oriented closed curve $\dlc$, we call the
line integral the &ldquo;circulation&rdquo; of $\dlvf$ around $\dlc$:
\begin{align*}
  \dlint = \text{circulation of $\dlvf$ around $\dlc$}.
\end{align*}
Sometimes one might write the integral as 
\begin{align*}
  \oint_{\dlc} \dlvf  \cdot d\lis
\end{align*}
to emphasize that the integral is around a closed curve, but we tend
to omit the circle decoration on the integral sign since it is redundant.</p>

<p>The circulation can be positive or negative, depending on
the orientation of $\dlc$ compared to the flow of $\dlvf$.  For
example, let $\dlvf(x,y) = (y,-x)$ and $\dlc$ be the ellipse
\begin{align*}
  \frac{x^2}{4}+\frac{y^2}{9} =1
\end{align*}
oriented counterclockwise.  As shown in the graph, 
the vector field appears to circulate in the clockwise direction, tending
to point in the opposite direction of the orientation of the
curve. We expect the circulation $\dlint$ to be negative.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{%image vector_field_circulate_closed_curve%}</p>


<p>We can compute the circulation by parametrizing $\dlc$ by
\begin{align*}
  \dllp(t) = (2\cos t, 3 \sin t)
\end{align*}
for $0 \le t \le 2\pi$.  Since $\dllp'(t) = (-2\sin t, 3 \cos
t)$, the line integral is
\begin{align*}
  \dlint &amp;= \plint{0}{2\pi}{\dlvf}{\dllp}\\
  &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi} \dlvf(2\cos t, 3 \sin t) \cdot 
  (-2\sin t, 3 \cos t) dt\\
  &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi} (3 \sin t, -2\cos t) \cdot (-2\sin t, 3 \cos t) dt\\
  &amp;=\int_0^{2\pi} (-6 \sin^2t -6 \cos^2t) dt =  \int_0^{2\pi} -6 dt = -12\pi.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>In other cases, the circulation may not be so obvious in a picture.  For example, let
$\dlvf(x,y) = (-y,0)$ and let $\dlc$ be the counterclockwise oriented
unit circle, as pictured below.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{%image vector_field_shear_closed_curve%}</p>

<p>In this case, there is no obvious circulation of $\dlvf$.  However, if
you look closely at the alignment of the vector field, you will see
that it tends to align with the orientation of the curve.  The
circulation of $\dlvf$ around $\dlc$ is positive.</p>

<p>We verify this by calculating directly the circulation.  Parametrizing
the unit circle by $\dllp(t)=(\cos t, \sin t)$ for $0 \le t \le 2\pi$,
the circulation is
\begin{align*}
  \dlint &amp;= \plint{0}{2\pi}{\dlvf}{\dllp}\\
  &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi} \dlvf(\cos t, \sin t) \cdot 
  (-\sin t, \cos t) dt\\
  &amp;= \int_0^{2\pi} (- \sin t, 0) \cdot (-\sin t, \cos t) dt\\
  &amp;=\int_0^{2\pi} \sin^2t dt =  \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{1-\cos 2t}{2} dt = \pi.
\end{align*}

<h4>Circulation in vector calculus</h4>

<p>Circulation plays an important role in vector calculus.  
Circulation defined by line integrals forms the basis for the
&ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo; of the
{% intlink curl_idea %}curl of a vector field{%endintlink%}.
Three of the four fundamental theorems of vector calculus involve
circulation.  The link between the &ldquo;microscopic ciculation&rdquo; 
of the curl and the circulation defines by line integrals
forms the basis of {%intlink greens_theorem_idea%}Green's theorem{%endintlink%}
and {%intlink stokes_theorem_idea %}Stokes' theorem{%endintlink%}.
{% intlink conservative_vector_field_no_circulation%}Lack of circulation{%endintlink%} can 
be thought of as the
defining property of {% intlink conservative_vector_field_introduction%}conservative vector fields{%endintlink%}.
