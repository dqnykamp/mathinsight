<p>A line integral (sometimes called a path integral) is the integral of some function along a curve.
One can integrate a 
{% intlink "line_integral_scalar_function_introduction" %}scalar-valued
function{%endintlink%} along a curve, obtaining for example,
the mass of a wire from its density.  
One can also integrate a certain type of vector-valued functions along
a curve.  
These vector-valued functions are the ones where the input and output dimensions
are the same, and we usually represent them as
{% intlink "vector_field_overview" %}vector fields{%endintlink%}.
</p>


<p>One interpretation of the line integral of a vector field
is the amount of work that a force field does on a particle as it
moves along a curve.
To illustrate this concept, we return to the 
{% intlink "parametrized_curve_arc_length" %}slinky
example{% endintlink%} we used to introduce arc length.
Here, our slinky will be the helix 
{% intlink "parametrized_curve_introduction" %}parameterized{%endintlink%}
by the function $\dllp(t) = (\cos t, \sin t, t/(3\pi))$, for $0 \le t \le 6\pi$,</p>

<p>Imagine that you put a small magnetized
bead on your slinky (the bead has a small hole in it, so it can slide
along the slinky).  Next, imagine that you put a large magnet to the
left of the slink, as shown by the large green square in the below
applet.  The magnet
will induce a magnetic field $\dlvf(x,y,z)$, shown by the green
arrows.</p>

 
{% boxedapplet "helix_particle_magnet" %}

<p>Since the bead is magnetized, the magnetic field exerts a force on the
bead.  However, we'll assume the bead's position is constrained be at $\dllp(t)$.
We'll ignore any effects of the magnetic force on the position of the bead.</p>

<p>As you change $t$ to move the bead, work is done by the magnetic field on the bead.  Work equals
forces times distance.  If the magnetic field were aligned with
the direction of movement, calculating the work would be simple.</p>

<p>However, the bead does not move in the direction of the magnetic
field.  It is constrained to move along the slinky.  The work is
calculated from the component of the force <i>in the direction of
movement</i>.  For example, when the movement is 90 degrees from the
direction of the force, the magnetic field does no work.</p>

<p>First, what is the direction of movement?  It is
{% intlink "parametrized_curve_derivative_location_velocity" %}the direction given by the velocity{%endintlink%} $\dllp'(t)$.  Denote
by $\vc{T}$ the {% intlink "unit_vector_definition" %}unit vector{%endintlink%} in the direction of movement: $\vc{T}(t) =
\dllp'(t)/\|\dllp'(t)\|$.  Since $\dllp'(t)$ (and therefore
$\vc{T}$) is tangent to the path, we refer to $\vc{T}$ as the unit
tangent vector.  It is shown by the blue vector in the below
figure.</p>

{% boxedapplet "helix_particle_magnet_tangent_vector" %}

<p>The component of the force in the direction of movement is simply the
dot product of the force $\dlvf$ at the point $\dllp(t)$ with the tangent vector $\vc{T}(t)$, i.e., it is
$\dlvf(\dllp(t)) \cdot \vc{T}(t)$.  For shorthand, we'll write it as
$\dlvf \cdot \vc{T}$.  This number is displayed by the
cyan  mark on the green slider.  Recall that the dot product is
zero if the two vectors are orthogonal, is negative if their angle is
greater than 90 degrees, and is positive if their angle is less than 90
degrees.</p>

<p>If we multiply the (component of) force $\dlvf \cdot \vc{T}$ by
distance, we get work.  Consequently, we can think of $\dlvf \cdot
\vc{T}$ as a scalar-valued function that gives work per unit length along the
slinky.  To get the total work, we simply need to take the
{% intlink "line_integral_scalar_function_introduction" %}line integral of this scalar-valued function{%endintlink%}.  In other words, the total work
is
\begin{align*}
  \text{Work} = \slint{\dlc}{\dlvf \cdot \vc{T}},
\end{align*}
where $\dlc$ is the path of the slinky.  This integral
adds up the product of force ($\dlvf \cdot \vc{T}$) and distance
($d\als$) along the slinky, which is work.</p>

<p>To derive a formula for this work, we use the formula for the 
{% intlink "line_integral_scalar_function_introduction" %}line integral of a scalar-valued
function{%endintlink%} $\dlsi$ in terms of the parameterization $\dllp(t)$, 
\begin{align*}
  \slint{\dlc}{\dlsi}=\dpslint
\end{align*}
When we replace $\dlsi$ with $\dlvf \cdot \vc{T}$, we get
\begin{align*}
  \slint{\dlc}{\dlvf \cdot \vc{T}}
  = \int_a^b \dlvf(\dllp(t)) \cdot \vc{T}(t)\| \dllp'(t) \| dt,
\end{align*}
where for our parametrization $\dllp(t)$ of the slinky, $a=0$ and $b=6\pi$.</p>

<p>We can simplify this further.  Remember that $\vc{T}(t) =
\dllp'(t)/\|\dllp'(t)\|$.  Consquently, the two occurrences of
$\|\dllp'(t)\|$ cancel, and we are left with
\begin{align*}
 \slint{\dlc}{\dlvf \cdot \vc{T}} = \dplint.
\end{align*}
We usually write $\vc{T} \, d\als$ as $d\lis$.  Hence, the important formula to know is that the line
integral of a vector field is
\begin{align*}
  \dlint = \dplint,
\end{align*}
where the curve $\dlc$ is parametrized by the function $\dllp(t)$ for $a
\le t \le b$.

<h4>The fundamental role of line integrals in vector calculus</h4>

<p>The line integral of a vector field plays a
crucial role in vector calculus.  Out of the
{% intlink "fundamental_theorems_vector_calculus_summary" %}four fundamental
theorems of vector calculus{%endintlink%},
three of them involve line integrals of vector fields.  
{% intlink "greens_theorem_idea" %}Green's theorem{%endintlink%}
and {% intlink "stokes_theorem_idea" %}Stokes' theorem{%endintlink%} relate
{% intlink "line_integral_circulation" %}line integrals around 
closed curves{%endintlink%} to 
{% intlink "double_integral_introduction" %}double integrals{%endintlink%}
or {% intlink "surface_integral_vector_field_introduction" %}surface integrals{%endintlink%}.
If you have a {% intlink "conservative_vector_field_introduction" %}conservative vector field{%endintlink%},
you can {% intlink "gradient_theorem_line_integrals" %}relate the line integral{%endintlink%} over a curve to quantities just at the 
curve's two boundary points.
It's worth the effort to develop a good understanding of line integrals.</p>
