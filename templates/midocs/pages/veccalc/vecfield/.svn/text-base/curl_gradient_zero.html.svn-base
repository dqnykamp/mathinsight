{% description "Calculation showing that the curl of a gradient is zero." %}

<p>Let $f(x,y,z)$ be a scalar-valued function.  Then its
{%intlink gradient_vector %}gradient{%endintlink%}
$$\nabla f(x,y,z) = \left(\pdiff{f}{x}(x,y,z),\pdiff{f}{y}(x,y,z),\pdiff{f}{z}(x,y,z)\right)$$
is a vector field, which we denote by $\dlvf = \nabla f$.
We can easily calculate that the {%intlink curl_idea %}curl{%endintlink%}
of $\dlvf$ is zero.</p>

<p>We use the formula for $\curl\dlvf$ in terms of 
{%intlink curl_components %}its components{%endintlink%}
$$\curl \dlvf = \left(\pdiff{\dlvfc_3}{y}-\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{z}, \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{z} -
  \pdiff{\dlvfc_3}{x}, \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y} \right).$$
Since each component of $\dlvf$ is a derivative of $f$, we can rewrite the curl as
$$\curl \nabla f = \left(\frac{\partial f^2}{\partial y \partial z}
-\frac{\partial f^2}{\partial z \partial y},
\frac{\partial f^2}{\partial z \partial x}
-\frac{\partial f^2}{\partial x \partial z},
\frac{\partial f^2}{\partial x \partial y}
-\frac{\partial f^2}{\partial y \partial x}\right).$$
</p>

<p>If $f$ is twice continuously differentiable, then its second 
derivatives are independent of the order in which the derivatives
are applied.  All the terms cancel in the expression for $\curl \nabla f$, 
and we conclude that $\curl \nabla f=\vc{0}.$</p>
