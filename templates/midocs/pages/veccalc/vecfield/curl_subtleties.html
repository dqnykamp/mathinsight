<h4>Macroscopic versus microscopic circulation</h4>

<p>We {%intlink curl_idea %}introduced the curl of a vector field{%endintlink%} as
the <i>microscopic circulation</i> of the vector field.  In that
introductory reading we attempted to keep things as simple as
possible, so we didn't make a big fuss over the difference between
macroscopic circulation of the vector around in circles and the
microscopic circulation that curl measures.  For the example vector
field we showed, the microscopic and macroscopic circulations were
essentially the same, so we didn't have to worry about the difference
between them.</p>

<p>The vector field $\dlvf(x,y,z) = (-y,x,0)$ is similar to the vector
field of the introductory reading except that the rotation is around
the $z$-axis.  In this case, the macroscopic circulation is
counterclockwise when viewed from the positive $z$-axis.  In this
case, we can see circulation by placing a sphere in the fluid and
allowing it to move freely with the fluid. (Unfortunately, this method
doesn't always work.) The macroscopic circulation is evident by the
sphere's circling around the $z$-axis.  Since this vector field has no
$z$-component and is independent of $z$, we may be able to get a
better picture of the action by looking at the projection in the
$xy$-plane, viewed from the positive $z$-axis, which is shown to the
right.  In all the examples on this page, we'll use vector fields with
this property, and each figure will show the three-dimensional graph at the left
along with its two-dimensional projection at the right.</p>


{% boxedapplet "circling_sphere_curl" %}


<p>It is important to remember that this macroscopic circulation isn't
the curl of the vector field.  Recall that {%intlink curl_idea %}in
  order to measure the microscopic circulation of the curl{%endintlink%}, one needs
to <b>fix the center</b> of the sphere and allow it to rotate freely
around the center.  In this example, there is nothing tricky, and the
rotation is again counterclockwise when viewed from the positive
$z$-axis.  Using the right hand rule, the curl points in the positive
$z$ direction, as shown by the green arrow.  Indeed, $\curl \dlvf =
(0,0,2)$.</p>

{% boxedapplet "rotating_sphere_curl" %}


<p>However, you may or may not be surprised to learn that for some vector
fields, the microscopic and macroscopic circulations could be quite
different.  The definition of curl as microscopic circulation is a
little more subtle than it just being a measure of the rotation of the
vector field.</p>

{% navigation_tag "curlfreecirc" "Curl-free circulation" %}
<h4>Curl-free macroscopic circulation</h4>

<p>In the vector field pictured below, there is clear macroscopic
circulation of the vector field around the $z$-axis.  If we placed a
sphere in a fluid with velocity given by the vector field, and allowed
the sphere to move freely with the fluid, it would circulate around
the $z$-axis as shown.</p>

{% boxedapplet "circling_sphere_no_curl" %}


<p>Does this circulation correspond to the microscopic circulation of
curl?  Again, one needs to <b>fix the center</b> of the sphere to
measure curl, as the motion of a free-floating sphere does not
correspond to curl.  If the sphere still spins when its center is
fixed, such spinning around its center would measure the microscopic
circulation of curl (at least if the sphere were very small).
As shown below, the sphere with its center fixed does not rotate,
indicating the absence of curl.</p>

{% boxedapplet "nonrotating_sphere_no_curl" %}

<p>This vector field is
$$\dlvf(x,y,z) =  \frac{(-y,x,0)}{x^2+y^2}$$
for $(x,y) \ne (0,0)$.  Along circles $x^2+y^2=$ constant, the vector
field is similar to the first vector field, above, giving the vector
field the macroscopic circulation around the $z$-axis.  However, due
to the denominator, the vector field shrinks rapidly as one moves away
from the $z$-axis.  Since for $(x,y) \ne (0,0)$,
$$\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} =\pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}= \frac{y^2-x^2}{(x^2+y^2)^2}$$
{% intlink curl_components curlformula %}one can compute{%endintlink%} that away from the
$z$-axis, $\curl \dlvf(x,y,z) = (0,0,0)$.</p>


<p>How can one see from the picture that the microscopic circulation is
zero?  The general rotation of the flow around the $z$-axis in the
counterclockwise direction (as viewed from the positive $z$-axis)
would indeed tend to make the sphere spin in that direction.  But,
since the arrows are longer closer to the $z$-axis, the vector field
tends to push the sphere more strongly on the side closest to the
$z$-axis.  This second effect would tend to make the sphere spin in
the clockwise direction (viewed from the positive $z$-axis).  In this
example, I have chosen the vector field so that the two effects
precisely cancel each other out so that the curl is zero.</p>

{% navigation_tag "oppositecurl" "Opposite curl" %}
<h4>Curl that is opposite of macroscopic circulation</h4>

<p>Of course, the effects need not balance.  For the vector field
$$\dlvf(x,y,z) =  \frac{(-y,x,0)}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}},$$
for $(x,y) \ne (0,0)$, the length of the arrows diminishes even faster
as one moves away from the $z$-axis.  In this case, the microscopic
circulation is opposite of the macroscopic circulation, and the sphere
with a fixed center rotates clockwise (when viewed from the positive
$z$-axis), as shown below.  Using the right hand rule,
$\curl \dlvf$ must point downward, as shown by the green arrow.  We
can calculate that for $(x,y) \ne (0,0)$, $$\curl \dlvf(x,y,z) =
\frac{(0,0,-1)}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}.$$</p>

<h4>Is there a relationship between macroscopic and
  microscopic circulation?</h4>

<p>In the above counterexamples, we've shown cases where the macroscopic
circulation seemed to be unrelated to the microscopic circulation
(i.e., the curl).  This observations may lead one to wonder if there
is any relationship between the macroscopic and microscopic
circulation. </p>

<p>First of all, roughly speaking, the microscopic circulation measured
by the curl is the average {% intlink line_integral_circulation %}macroscopic
  circulation{%endintlink%} around a loop in the 
  {%intlink curl_definition_line_integral %}limit that the size of the loop
  shrinks to zero{%endintlink%}.  Therefore, assuming the vector field is
continuous, the macroscopic circulation should begin to approach the
microscopic circulation as one looks at smaller loops.</p>

<p>Moreover, it turns out that there is a fundamental relationship
between macroscopic circulation and curl, but we designed these
counterexamples to sidestep that relationship.  Note that for each of
these counterexamples, the vector field was not defined along the
$z$-axis.  If, for example, the vector field was continuously
differentiable everywhere, then there is a fundamental relationship
between curl and macroscopic circulation called
{%intlink stokes_theorem_idea %}Stokes' theorem{%endintlink%}.  If Stokes' theorem
applied, then we'd know that the macroscopic circulation around any
loop would be determined by the curl inside the loop.  Understanding
Stokes' theorem, however, requires quite a bit more background than
this presentation of the curl, including {% intlink line_integral_vector_field_introduction %}line
  integrals{%endintlink%} and {%intlink surface_integral_vector_field_introduction %}surface integrals{%endintlink%} of vector
fields.</p>

</aside>

<h4>Circulation may not be obvious from pictures</h4>


<p>For the vector field $\dlvf(x,y,z) = (y,0,0)$, no rotation is readily
apparent, as the vector field is always parallel to the $x$-axis.
However, if we place a sphere in the flow and fix its center, it does
indeed spin.  The spin is clockwise when viewed from the positive
$z$-axis, so the curl points in the negative $z$ direction as shown by
the green arrow.  Indeed, one can easily calculate that $\curl
\dlvf(x,y,z) = (0,0,-1)$.</p>


{% boxedapplet "rotating_sphere_shear_flow" %} 

<p>The sphere spins because the flow on the positive $y$ side the sphere
pushes the sphere more strongly in the positive $x$ direction,
compared with the flow on the negative $y$ side of the sphere.</p>

<p>In this case, the subtle issue isn't between microscopic and
macroscopic circulation.  The macroscopic circulation, as
{% intlink line_integral_circulation %}one might define it via line integrals{%endintlink%},
would also be clockwise when viewed from the positive $z$ axis.  Since
such macroscopic circulation cannot be measured by letting a sphere
float freely in the flow, this example shows how measuring macroscopic
circulation with spheres doesn't always work.</p>
