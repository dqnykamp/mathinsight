{% description "Intuitive introduction to the curl of a vector field. Interactive graphics illustrate basic concepts." %}

<p>The {% intlink "divergence_idea" %}divergence{%endintlink%} and curl of a 
{% intlink "vector_field_overview" %}vector field{%endintlink%} are two vector operators whose basic properties can be understood geometrically by viewing a vector field as the flow of a fluid or gas.
Divergence is discussed on a {% intlink "divergence_idea" %}companion page{%endintlink%}.  Here we give an overview of basic properties of curl than can be intuited from fluid flow.</p>

<p>The curl of a vector field captures the idea of how a fluid
may rotate.  Imagine that the below vector field $\dlvf$ represents
fluid flow.  The vector field indicates that the fluid is circulating
around a central axis.</p>

{% boxedapplet "curl_vector_field" %}

<p>This macroscopic circulation of fluid around circles (i.e., the
rotation you can easily view in the above graph) actually is not what
curl measures.  But, it turns out that this vector field also has
curl, which we might think of as &ldquo;microscopic circulation.&rdquo;  To test
for curl, imagine that you immerse a small sphere into the fluid flow,
and you fix the center of the sphere at some point so that the sphere
cannot follow the fluid around.  Although you fix the center of the
sphere, you allow the sphere to rotate in any direction around its
center point.  The rotation of such a sphere is illustrated in the
below applet.
The rotation of the
sphere measures the curl of the vector field $\dlvf$ at the point in
the center of the sphere.  (The sphere should actually be really
really small, because, remember, the curl is <i>microscopic</i>
circulation.)</p>

{% boxedapplet "curl_vector_field_sphere" %}


<p>The vector field $\dlvf$ determines both <i>in what direction</i>
the sphere rotates, and <i>the speed</i> at which it rotates.  We
define the curl of $\dlvf$, denoted $\curl \dlvf$, by a vector that
points along the axis of the rotation and whose length corresponds to
the speed of the rotation.  (As the curl is a vector, it is very different
from the {% intlink "divergence_idea" %}divergence{%endintlink%}, which is a scalar.)</p>


<p>We can draw the vector corresponding to $\curl \dlvf$ as follows.
We make the length of the vector $\curl \dlvf$ proportional to the
speed of the sphere's rotation.   The direction of
$\curl \dlvf$ points along the axis of rotation, but we need to
specify in which direction along this axis the vector should point.
We will (arbitrarily?) set the direction of the curl vector by using
the follwing  &ldquo;right hand rule.&rdquo;  To see where $\curl \dlvf$ should
point, curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction the sphere
is rotating; your thumb will point in the direction of $\curl \dlvf$.
For our example, $\curl \dlvf$ is shown by
the <span style="color:green"> green</span> arrow.  </p>

{% boxedapplet "curl_vector_field_sphere_vector" %}

<p>For this particular vector field, it turns out that $\curl \dlvf$
doesn't change with position (this, of course, is not true in
general).  For example, if we move the sphere to another location, it
will still spin in the same direction with the same speed.  Can you
see why the sphere spins the same way when the sphere is in the
location shown below?  (See {% intlink "curl_vector_field_sphere_vector_2" class="applet" %}the applet's page{% endintlink %} for more information.)</p>

{% boxedapplet "curl_vector_field_sphere_vector_2" %}

<p>The curl is a three-dimensional vector, and each of its three
components turns out to be a combination of derivatives of the vector
field $\dlvf$.  You can read about one can {% intlink "curl_components" %}use the same spinning spheres to obtain insight into the components{%endintlink%} of
the vector $\curl \dlvf$.  The formula for the curl components may
seem ugly at first, and some {% intlink "divergence_curl_notation" %}clever notation{%endintlink%}
can help you remember the formula.  Once you have the formula,
calculating the curl of a vector field is a simple matter, as shown by
{% intlink "divergence_curl_examples" %}this example{%endintlink%}.</p>

  <h4>Don't get misled</h4>

<p>The presentation of idea of curl via pictures does come with an
important warning.  One must remember that pictures can be deceiving.
In particular, one might incorrectly think that the curl is due to the
macroscopic circulation of the vector field that one readily notices
in the above pictures.  Be forewarned that this assumption is far from
the truth!  If you think you might get confused between the
microscopic circulation of the curl and the macroscopic circulation
that one can observe from a picture, we urge you to check out some
{% intlink "curl_subtleties" %}subtleties about the curl{%endintlink%} that may help you
really understand curl.</p>
