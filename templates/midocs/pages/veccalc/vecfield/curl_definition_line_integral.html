{% title "The definition of curl from line integrals" %}
{% description "How the curl of a vector field is defined by line integrals representing circulation." %}
<p>We can get a {% intlink "curl_components" %}pretty good intuition{%endintlink%}
behind the formula for the components of the curl by just visualizing
spinning spheres immersed in fluid.  
However, to really master curl and the meaning of its components,
you need to understand the basis of curl from the 
{% intlink "line_integral_circulation" %}circulation{%endintlink%} that is
captured by 
{% intlink "line_integral_vector_field_introduction" %}line integrals{%endintlink%}.</p>

<p>In fact, the way one formally defines the curl of a vector field is 
through line integrals.  
We define the vector $\curl \dlvf$ by prescribing an expression for
any component $\curl \dlvf \cdot \vc{u}$ of the curl vector in the direction
of the {% intlink "unit_vector_definition" %}unit vector{% endintlink%} $\vc{u}$.
To define the curl at a point $\vc{a} \in \R^3$, we let $\dlc$ 
be a {% intlink "closed_curve_definition" %}closed curve{%endintlink%} around $\vc{a}$ lying in a plane perpendicular to $\vc{u}$.
We orient $\dlc$ by the right-hand rule, so that when the fingers of your
right hand curl in the direction of the orientation of $\dlc$, 
your right thumb points in the direction of $\vc{u}$.</p>

<p>The circulation of the vector field $\dlvf: \R^3 \to \R^3$ {% confusedlink "function_notation" %} around 
$\dlc$ is given by the {% intlink "line_integral_circulation" %}line integral{%endintlink%} of $\dlvf$ around $\dlc$: $\dlint.$ 
The line integral is just a number, and if we divide it by the area inside $\dlc$, which we'll denote by $A(\dlc)$, 
we get an expression for the circulation per unit area:
$$\frac{1}{A(\dlc)} \dlint.$$</p>

<p>We define the component $\curl \dlvf(\vc{a}) \cdot \vc{u}$ of the curl 
of $\dlvf$ at point $\vc{a}$ in the direction $\vc{u}$ as the limit of this
circulation per unit area as the curve $\dlc$ shrinks to a point, i.e.,
as the area $A(\dlc)$ goes to zero:
\begin{align*}
  \curl \dlvf(\vc{a}) \cdot \vc{u} = \lim_{A(\dlc)\to 0} \frac{1}{A(\dlc)} \dlint.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>To make sure this definition is valid, one would need to show
that this limit converges to a number and that this number 
doesn't depend on the choice of $\dlc$.  But we won't address those details 
here.  Let's just assume this definition works out.</p>

<p>We can use this definition to set up line integrals that 
should give the {% intlink "curl_components" %}formulas for the curl 
components{%endintlink%} in the directions of the standard unit vectors.
Let's focus on the $z$ component $\curl \dlvf \cdot \vc{k}$.
We {% intlink "curl_components" %}can visualize this component{%endintlink%}
as the rotation of a ball on a rod parallel to the $z$-axis.</p>

{% boxedapplet "z_component_curl_sphere" %}


<p>According to our above definition, we need to construct a 
curve centered at the sphere's location in a plane parallel to the $xy$-plane.
The curve must be oriented with the right-hand
rule to correspond to $\vc{k}$, or the positive $z$ direction, i.e.,
it should be oriented counterclockwise when viewed from the positive
$z$-axis.  The following applet illustrates such a curve.</p>

{% boxedapplet "z_component_curl_line_integral" %}

<p>The integral $\dlint$ measures the circulation around $\dlc$.  
To estimate the &ldquo;microscopic circulation,&rdquo; corresponding to
$\curl \dlvf \cdot \vc{k}$, we just need to divide by the area inside $\dlc$
and let $\dlc$ shrink to a point.  By comparing the above two applets,
you can see how the circulation of $\dlvf$ around $\dlc$ captures the
&ldquo;microscopic circulation,&rdquo; that would make a tiny sphere
on the rod spin.</p>

<p>To obtain a formula for $\curl \dlvf \cdot \vc{k}$, we need to choose
a particular $\dlc$.  The simplest case is to make $\dlc$ be a rectangle.
You can {% intlink "circulation_unit_area_calculation" %}read a sketch of the
proof{% endintlink %} why for such a $\dlc$, we obtain that the $z$-component 
of the curl is
\begin{align*}
  \curl \dlvf \cdot \vc{k} = \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>One can perform similar calculations to determine the formulas for the
other components of the curl, as given in the
{% intlink "curl_components" %}page introducing the curl components{%endintlink%}.
