<p>This overview introduces the basic concept of vector fields in two or
three dimensions.</p>

<h4>Vector fields in two dimensions</h4>

<p>A vector-valued function $\dlvf:\R^2 \rightarrow \R^2$ {% confusedlink "function_notation" %} can be
visualized as a vector field.  At a point $(x,y)$, we plot the value
of $\dlvf(x,y)$ as a vector with tail anchored at $(x,y)$, such as in
the following figure.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "vector_field_single_vector" %}</p>

<p>We repeat this over a set of points $(x,y)$ so that we can visualize
the entire vector field.</p>


<p>For example, consider the function $\dlvf(x,y) = (y, -x)$.  We
calculate values of the function at a set of points, such as
\begin{align*}
  \dlvf(1,0)&amp;=\color{#005000}{(0,-1)},\\
  \dlvf(0,1)&amp;=\color{blue}{(1,0)},\\
  \dlvf(1,1)&amp;=\color{#800000}{(1,-1)},\\
  \dlvf(1,2)&amp;=\color{#005080}{(2,-1)}.
  \end{align*}
By plotting each of these vectors anchored at the corresponding
points, we begin to see some of the structure of the vector field.</p>

<p>If we continued plotting such vectors at many points, they would begin
to overlap and look quite messy.  Hence, we typically scale the
arrows in vector field plots (usually without commenting on this
fact).  In the below example, we drew the vectors at only 40% their
actual length.  By plotting this field of arrows, we see that the
vector field $\dlvf(x,y) = (y, -x)$ appears to rotate in a clockwise direction.</p>

<p>If we visualize in this way the vector field $\dlvf(x,y) = (x,y)$, it
looks like an explosion emanating from the origin.  At each point
$(x,y)$, the vector $\dlvf(x,y)$ points precisely away form the
origin.  If we drew the arrows to scale, they would be as long as the
distance to the origin, but again, the drawn arrows are shorter than
the actual values of the vector field.</p>

<h4>Vector fields in three dimensions</h4>

<p>We can also plot vector fields in three dimensions, i.e., for
functions $\dlvf: \R^3 \rightarrow \R^3$.  The principle is exactly
the same; we plot vectors of length proportional to $\dlvf(x,y,z)$
with tail anchored at the point $(x,y,z)$.  In three dimensions,
vector fields are harder to visualize.  Rotating the graphs can make
the three-dimensional structure more apparent.  </p>

<p>For example, the three-dimensional analogue of the above picture would
be $\dlvf(x,y,z)=(x,y,z)$.  As in the two-dimesional case, this vector
field corresponds to an explosion from the origin.  In the below
graph, we show only the portion of the vector field with $x>0$, $y>0$,
and $z>0$.</p>

<p>The vector field $\dlvf(x,y,z)=(y/z,-x/z,0)$ corresponds to a rotation
in three dimensions, where the vector rotates around the $z$-axis.
This vector field is similar to the two-dimensional rotation above.  In
this case, since we divided by $z$, the magnitude of the vector field
decreases as $z$ increases.</p>

{% boxedapplet "rotating_vector_field_3D" %}

<p>In general, the behavior of a three-dimensional vector field isn't so
easy to see from the graph.  For example, the structure of the vector
field $\dlvf = (-y, xy,z)$ is harder to see from the graph.</p>
