{% description "Interpretation of vector fields as velocity fields of fluids." %}

<p>As described in the {%intlink Vector_field_overview %}vector field
  overview{%endintlink%}, a two-dimensional vector field is a vector-valued
function $\dlvf:\R^2 \to \R^2$ {% confusedlink function_notation %} that one can visualize with a
field of arrows.  For example, the below graph is a visualization of
the vector field $\dlvf(x,y)=(y,-x)$.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "vector_field_circulate" %}</p>

<p>One can think of such a vector field as representing fluid flow in two
dimensions, so that $\dlvf(x,y)$ gives the velocity of a fluid at the
point $(x,y)$.  In this case, we may call $\dlvf(x,y)$ the velocity
field of the fluid.  With this interpretation, the above example
illustrates the clockwise circulation of fluid around the origin.</p>

<p>The same interpretation is possible for a three-dimensional fluid flow
with velocity represented by a vector field $\dlvf:\R^3 \to \R^3$.  In
this case, $\dlvf(x,y,z)$ is the velocity of the fluid at the point
$(x,y,z)$, and we can visualize it as the vector $\dlvf(x,y,z)$
positioned a the point $(x,y,z)$.  For example,
$\dlvf(x,y,z)=(y/z,-x/z,0)$ can be viewed as fluid circulating around
the $z$-axis.</p>

<p>The interpretation of vector fields as fluid flow can be useful in
understanding basic properties of vector fields, such as
{% intlink divergence_idea %}divergence{%endintlink%} and {%intlink curl_idea %}curl{%endintlink%}, as
well as important results in vector analysis, such as
{%intlink greens_theorem_idea %}Green's theorem{%endintlink%} and
{%intlink stokes_theorem_idea %}Stokes' theorem{%endintlink%}.</p>
