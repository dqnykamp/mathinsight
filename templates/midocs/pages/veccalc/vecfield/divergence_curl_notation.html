<p>For $\dlvf: \R^3 \to \R^3$ {% confusedlink "function_notation" %}, the formulas for the {% intlink "divergence_idea" %}divergence{%endintlink%} and  {% intlink "curl_idea" %}curl{%endintlink%}
are
\begin{align*}
  \div \dlvf &amp;= \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{x} + \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{y} + \pdiff{\dlvfc_3}{z}\\
  \curl \dlvf &amp;= \left(\pdiff{\dlvfc_3}{y}-\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{z}, \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{z} -
  \pdiff{\dlvfc_3}{x}, \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y} \right).
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>These formulas are easy to memorize using a tool called the &ldquo;del&rdquo;
operator, denoted by $\nabla$.  Think of $\nabla$ as a &ldquo;fake&rdquo; vector
composed of all the partial derivatives that we use just to help us
remember the formulas:
\begin{align*}
  \nabla = \left(\pdiff{}{x}, \pdiff{}{y}, \pdiff{}{z}\right).
\end{align*}
Although it may not seem to make sense to just have the partial
derivatives without them acting on a function, we won't worry about
that.  This is just notation.</p>

<p>Now, let's take the dot product of the $\nabla$ vector with
$\dlvf=(\dlvfc_1,\dlvfc_2, \dlvfc_3)$:
\begin{align*}
  \nabla \cdot \dlvf &amp;= \left(\pdiff{}{x}, \pdiff{}{y},
    \pdiff{}{z}\right)
  \cdot (\dlvfc_1,\dlvfc_2, \dlvfc_3)\\
  &amp;= \pdiff{}{x}\dlvfc_1 + \pdiff{}{y}\dlvfc_2 +  
    \pdiff{}{z}\dlvfc_3
\end{align*}
If we think of each &ldquo;multiplication&rdquo; in the dot product as instead
being the derivative of the corresponding $\dlvfc$, then we have the
formula for the divergence.  So, if you can remember the del operator
$\nabla$ and how to take a dot product, you can easily remember the
formula for the divergence
\begin{align*}
  \div \dlvf = \nabla \cdot \dlvf = 
  \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{x} + \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{y} + \pdiff{\dlvfc_3}{z}.
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>This notation is also helpful because you will always know that
$\nabla \cdot \dlvf$ is a scalar (since, of course, you know that the
dot product is a scalar product).</p>

<p>The curl, on the other hand, is a vector.  We know one product that
gives a vector: the {% intlink "cross_product" %}cross product{%endintlink%}.  And, yes, it turns out that
$\curl \dlvf$ is equal to $\nabla \times \dlvf$.  To see this, let's
take the cross product of the $\nabla$ vector with $\dlvf$.
\begin{align*}
  \nabla \times \dlvf &amp;= \left(\pdiff{}{x}, \pdiff{}{y},
    \pdiff{}{z}\right)
  \times (\dlvfc_1,\dlvfc_2, \dlvfc_3)\\
  &amp;= 
  \left|
    \begin{array}{ccc}
      \vc{i} &amp; \vc{j} &amp; \vc{k}\\
      \pdiff{}{x} &amp; \pdiff{}{y} &amp; \pdiff{}{z}\\
      \dlvfc_1 &amp; \dlvfc_2 &amp; \dlvfc_3
    \end{array}
  \right|
  \\
  &amp;= 
  \vc{i} \left(\pdiff{}{y}\dlvfc_3
    - \pdiff{}{z}\dlvfc_2\right)
  - \vc{j} \left(\pdiff{}{x} \dlvfc_3
    -\pdiff{}{z}\dlvfc_1\right)
  + \vc{k} \left(\pdiff{}{x}\dlvfc_2 - \pdiff{}{y}\dlvfc_1\right)
  \\
  &amp;= 
   \left(\pdiff{\dlvfc_3}{y} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{z}\right)\vc{i}
  + \left(\pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{z} -\pdiff{\dlvfc_3}{x}\right)\vc{j} 
  + \left(\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}\right)\vc{k} 
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>This is exactly the formula we gave above.  So if you can use the rule
that &ldquo;multiplication&rdquo; by $\pdiff{}{x}$ is the same as taking the
partial derivative with respect to $x$ (and similar for the other
derivatives), then you can remember the curl formula by
\begin{align*}
  \curl \dlvf = \nabla \times \dlvf.
\end{align*}
