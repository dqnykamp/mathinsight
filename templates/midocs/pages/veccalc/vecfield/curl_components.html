<p>Recall that one can {% intlink "curl_idea" %}visualize the curl of a
three-dimensional vector field{%endintlink%}
$\dlvf=(\dlvfc_1,\dlvfc_2,\dlvfc_3)$ by inserting a small sphere into
a {% intlink "vector_field_fluid_flow" %}fluid with flow given
by{%endintlink%} $\dlvf$, fixing the center of the sphere, and
allowing the sphere to rotate in any direction.  The direction of the
vector $\curl \dlvf$ is given using the right hand rule, and the
magnitude $\| \curl \dlvf \|$ is given by the speed at which the
sphere rotates, as shown in the following figure.</p>

{% boxedapplet "curl_vector_field_sphere_vector_2" %}

<p>Since $\curl \dlvf$ is a three-dimensional vector, it has components
in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions.  If we let $\vc{v} = \curl
\dlvf$, then we could write $\curl \dlvf$ in terms of components as
$$\curl \dlvf = \vc{v} = v_1 \vc{i} + v_2 \vc{j} + v_3 \vc{k}.$$
To visualize the components of the curl, we can use the rotating
sphere animation with just small modifications.</p>

{% navigation_tag "zcomponent" "The components" "<i>z</i>-component" %}
<h4>$z$-component of curl</h4>

<p>To visualize $v_3$, the component of the curl in
the $z$ direction, we could place our sphere in the fluid as before,
only with one important difference.  Rather than allowing the sphere
to rotate in any direction, we place the sphere on a rod that is
parallel to the $z$-axis.  The rod allows the sphere to rotate only
around the axis of the rod.  Using the right hand rule, we see that
the &ldquo;direction vector&rdquo; corresponding to the rotation must point along the
rod, i.e., it is parallel to the $z$-axis.  In fact, this rotation
corresponds $v_3 \vc{k}$, where $v_3$ is the component of the curl in
the $z$ direction.  The speed of the rotation corresponds to $|v_3|$,
while the sign of $v_3$ indicates the direction of rotation around the
axis.</p>

{% boxedapplet "z_component_curl_sphere" %}

<p>From the above animation, we see that that the sphere is rotating in a
counterclockwise direction when viewed from the positive $z$-axis.
This rotation means that the component of the curl in
the $z$ direction is positive (using the right hand rule).  If the
sphere were rotating clockwise when viewed from the positive $z$-axis, 
then the component of the curl
in the $z$ direction would be negative.  Since $\curl \dlvf$ is not
parallel to the $z$-axis, the magnitude of the $z$-component $v_3$ is 
smaller than the magnitude of $\curl \dlvf$, 
and the sphere is rotating more slowly than it
did when it was allowed to rotate freely.</p>

<p>You can visualize that
there is also &ldquo;macroscopic circulation&rdquo; in this same direction by
rotating the figure so that the $z$-axis is coming straight out of the
screen.  Viewed from that axis, the vector field still appears to
circulate.  (Remember, of course, that this &ldquo;macroscopic circulation&rdquo; 
{% intlink "curl_subtleties" %}doesn't neccesarily correspond to{%endintlink%} the &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo; of the curl.)</p>

<p>Notice that when the sphere is fixed to the rod, it cannot response to the 
$z$-component of the vector field; any push up or down of the fluid 
cannot affect the movement of the sphere. 
We can immediately deduce that the $z$-component of the curl should
not depend on the $z$-component of $\dlvf$.</p>

<p>What properties of the vector field $\dlvf$ will cause the sphere
to spin even when it is fixed to the rod?
Since we can ignore the $z$-component $\dlvfc_3$, we know the spinning must
depend only on the $x$-component $\dlvfc_1$ or the $y$-component $\dlvfc_2$ 
of the vector field.  Let's look at a slice of the vector field through the
sphere that is parallel to the $xy$-plane, as illustrated below.
This image is intended to represent the view of the above applet 
when rotated so that the $z$-axis is coming out of the screen.  
However, to make the visualization easier,
we moved the sphere (illustrated as a circle) to the
right so that it isn't on top of the $y$-axis.
</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{% image "microscopic_circulation_vector_field_change" %}</p>

<p>A positive $z$-component $v_3$ of the curl corresponds to counterclockwise
rotation from this view.  
One way to induce a counterclockwise rotation, would be to have the upward push
of the vector field on the right of the sphere be greater than the upward
push on the left of the sphere.  
This upward push corresponds to the the $y$-component $\dlvfc_2$ 
(illustrated by red arrows) of the vector field.  
The curl is supposed to correspond to &ldquo;microscopic circulation,&rdquo;
so we view the sphere is being very small.
The increase of $\dlvfc_2$ as we move a tiny bit to the right (i.e., increase $x$)
is captured by the 
{% intlink "partial_derivative_introduction" %}partial derivative{%endintlink%}
of $\dlvfc_2$ with respect to $x$.
Hence, it seems reasonable that a positive $\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x}$ 
would tend to lead to counterclockwise rotation from the point of view of our
picture, which is a rotation corresponding to a positive $z$-component of the curl.
A negative $\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x}$ would tend to induce clockwise rotation, or 
a negative $z$-component of the curl.
</p>

<p>We could also induce counterclockwise rotation by having the 
righward push of the vector field be larger on the bottom of the sphere 
than on the top.
Since this corresponds to $\dlvfc_1$ (illustrated by blue arrows) decreasing as $y$ increases,
we need a <i>negative</i> $\pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}$ to increase counterclockwise rotation
and make the $z$-component of the curl be larger.</p>

<p>We conclude that particular <i>changes</i> (i.e., derivatives) of $\dlvfc_1$ 
and $\dlvfc_2$ lead to the sphere spinning in a direction corresponding to 
the $z$-component of the curl.  
It turns out that the effects of these changes in $\dlvf$ simply add up.
Although we need 
{% intlink "line_integral_vector_field_introduction" %}line integrals{%endintlink%}
in order to {% intlink "curl_definition_line_integral" %}fill in all the
details{%endintlink%},
the above picture at least gives some intuition why the $z$-component of the
the curl is
$$v_3 = \curl \dlvf \cdot \vc{k} = \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}.$$</p>

<p>In the above discussion, we were able to ignore the $z$-component 
of the vector field as well as any dependence of the vector field on $z$.
Nothing would have changed if we had been discussing a two-dimensional vector
field in $\vc{x}$ and $\vc{y}$.  
Hence the quantity $\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y}$
also corresponds to the counterclockwise 
&ldquo;microscopic circulation,&rdquo; of a vector field in the plane,
which shows up, for example, in {% intlink "greens_theorem_idea" %}Green's
theorem{%endintlink%}.</p>


{% navigation_tag "ycomponent" "The components" "<i>y</i>-component" %}
<h4>$y$-component of curl</h4>

<p>Glancing at the original animation where the sphere can
rotate in any direction, we can see that the green arrow
corresponding to the curl is perpendicular to the $y$-axis.  
For our particular example vector field,
we can see the component $\curl \dlvf$ in the $y$ direction
is zero.  If we placed the sphere on a rod that is parallel to $y$
axis, the fluid flow would not make the sphere rotate.</p>

{% boxedapplet "no_y_component_curl_sphere" %}


<p>If you rotate the above figure so that the $y$-axis is coming straight
out of the screen, you can see that the vector field no longer looks
like it is rotating.  (Though, remember, {% intlink "curl_subtleties" %}this
  isn't a true test of curl{%endintlink%}, which is &ldquo;microscopic circulation.&rdquo;)
We can still calculate the component of $\curl \dlvf$ parallel to the
$y$-axis.  
If we used the same calculation as we did the for $z$-component, we
would conclude that the $y$-component of the curl is
$$v_2 = \curl \dlvf \cdot \vc{j} = \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{z} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_3}{x}.$$
In our example, $v_2$ is zero.</p>


{% navigation_tag "xcomponent" "The components" "<i>x</i>-component" %}
<h4>$x$-component of curl</h4>

<p>Lastly, we can visualize the component of $\curl \dlvf$ parallel to
the $x$-axis by placing the sphere on a rod parallel to the $x$-axis.
Looking at the green arrow in the first animation, we see this
should be nonzero for our example, and the below animation verifies
this.  As above, we could calculate this component of the curl as
$$v_1 = \curl \dlvf \cdot \vc{i} = \pdiff{\dlvfc_3}{y}-\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{z}.$$</p>

{% boxedapplet "x_component_curl_sphere" %}


<a id="curlformula" class="anchor"></a>
<p>In summary, we can see that the $\curl \dlvf$ is a vector whose
components indicate the &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo; in the $x$, $y$, and
$z$ directions, respectively:
$$\curl \dlvf = \biggl(\pdiff{\dlvfc_3}{y}-\pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{z}, \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{z} -
  \pdiff{\dlvfc_3}{x}, \pdiff{\dlvfc_2}{x} - \pdiff{\dlvfc_1}{y} \biggr).$$</p>

<h4>The component of the curl in any direction</h4>

<p>There isn't anything special about the
directions $\vc{i}$, $\vc{j}$, and $\vc{k}$
in the context of the components of the curl.
For any {% intlink "unit_vector_definition" %}unit vector{%endintlink%} $\vc{u}$, 
we can define the component of the curl in its direction as
the projection $\curl \dlvf \cdot \vc{u}$.
The curl component $\curl \dlvf \cdot \vc{u}$ gives the &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo; that corresponds to the rotation of a
sphere around a rod parallel to $\vc{u}$,
with the direction being determined by the right hand rule.
In fact, the way we 
{% intlink "curl_definition_line_integral" %}define curl{%endintlink%} is through this projection  $\curl \dlvf
\cdot \vc{u}$. 
The idea of curl in any direction $\vc{u}$ is also fundamental to
