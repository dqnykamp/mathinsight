{% description "Intuitive introduction to the divergence of a vector field. Interactive graphics illustrate basic concepts." %}

<p>Both the divergence and {% intlink curl_idea %}curl{%endintlink%} are vector operators whose properties are revealed by viewing a vector field as the flow of a fluid or gas.  
Here we focus on the geometric properties of the divergence; you can read a similar discussion of the curl on  {% intlink curl_idea %}another page{%endintlink%}.</p>

<p>The divergence of a vector field is relatively easy to
understand intuitively.  Imagine that the vector field $\dlvf$
pictured below gives the {%intlink vector_field_fluid_flow%}velocity of some
  fluid flow{%endintlink%}. 
It appears that the fluid is exploding outward from the origin.</p>



<p class="centeredImage">{%image vector_field_explosion%}</p>

<p>This expansion of fluid flowing with velocity field $\dlvf$ is
captured by the divergence of $\dlvf$,  which we denote $\div \dlvf$.  The divergence of the above vector field is positive since
the flow is expanding.</p>

<p>In contrast, the below vector field represents fluid flowing so that it
compresses as it moves toward the origin.  Since this compression of
fluid is the opposite of expansion, the divergence of this vector
field is negative.</p>

<p class="centeredImage">{%image vector_field_implosion%}</p>


<p>The divergence is defined for both two-dimensional vector fields
$\dlvf(x,y)$ and three-dimensional vector fields
$\dlvf(x,y,z)$.  A three-dimensional vector field
$\dlvf$ showing expansion of fluid flow is shown in
the below applet.  Again, because of
the expansion, we can conclude that $\div \dlvf(x,y)>0$.</p>

{% boxedapplet "divergent_vector_field" %}

<p>Now, imagine that one placed a sphere $\dls$ in the
fluid flow centered at the origin.  It is clear that the fluid is
flowing out of the sphere.</p>

{% boxedapplet "divergent_vector_field_sphere" %}

<p>When you learn about the
{%intlink divergence_theorem_idea%}divergence theorem{%endintlink%},
you will discover that the divergence of a vector
field and the flow out of spheres are closely related.  For a basic
understanding of divergence, it's
enough to see that if a fluid is expanding (i.e., the flow has
positive divergence everywhere inside the sphere), the net flow out of
a sphere will be positive.</p>

<p>Since the above vector field has positive divergence everywhere,
the flow out of the sphere will be positive even if we move the sphere
away from the origin.  Can you see why flow out is still positive even
when you move the sphere around using the sliders?</p>

{% boxedapplet "divergent_vector_field_movable_sphere" %}

<p>Notice that the arrows continue to get longer as one moves away from
the origin so that the fluid is flowing faster when it exits the
sphere than went it enters.  Moreover, since the arrows are radiating
outward, the fluid is always entering the sphere over less than half
its surface and is exiting the sphere over greater than half its
surface.  Hence, the flow out of the sphere is always greater than the
flow into the sphere.</p>

<p>The divergence of a vector field simply measures how much the flow is
expanding at a given point.  It does not indicate in which direction
the expansion is occuring.  Hence (in contrast to the
{%intlink curl_idea %}curl of a vector field{%endintlink%}), the divergence is a
scalar. Once you know the 
{%intlink Divergence_curl_notation %}formula for the divergence{%endintlink%},
it's quite simple to calculate the divergence of a
vector, such as in {%intlink divergence_curl_examples%}this example{%endintlink%}.</p>

  <h4>Observing divergence from pictures?</h4>

  <p><b>Warning:</b> these simple examples of visualizing divergence
  might be misleading.  Estimating divergence from a picture is not so simple as it might
  seem from the above discussion, which was intentionally
  oversimplified to illustrate the concept of divergence.  Detecting expansion of a fluid flow
  is not simply a matter of looking for flow that is radiating
  outward.  In fact, one could have flow that radiates outward even as
  a fluid is compressing (which could occur if the flow is slowing
  down as it moves outward).  To protect yourself from being mislead
  by pictures of vector fields, check out some
  {%intlink divergence_subtleties %}examples illustrating subtleties of the
  divergence{%endintlink%}.</p>
