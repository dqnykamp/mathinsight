<h4>Picture of divergence as expansion</h4>

<p>We have shown that {% intlink divergence_idea %}the divergence measures
  expansion or compression of a vector field{%endintlink%}.  We immersed a sphere
into a vector field that had positive divergence everywhere, as shown
below.  No matter where one moves the sphere (using the sliders), more
fluid flows out of the sphere than into the sphere, indicating the
fluid is expanding.</p>

{% boxedapplet "divergent_vector_field_movable_sphere" %}

<p>The vector field pictured is
\begin{align*}
  \dlvf(x,y,z) = (x,y,z).
  \label{vecfield1}
\end{align*}
Its
divergence is
\begin{align*}
  \div \dlvf(x,y,z) = \pdiff{}{x}x + \pdiff{}{y}y + \pdiff{}{z}z = 1+1+1=3,
\end{align*}
which is a positive constant independent of the point $(x,y,z)$.  The
picture of the vector field looks like fluid exploding outward, so it
makes sense that the fluid is expanding.</p>


{% navigation_tag "misleading" "Misleading picture" %}
<h4>Can a picture be misleading?</h4>

<p>As one becomes more sophisticated in mathematical thinking, one
discovers that pictures can sometimes be misleading.  (One reason
mathematicians demand mathematical proof is to ensure they aren't
fooling themselves into jumping to conclusions based on incomplete
information, such as the information gained solely by exploring
pictures.)  With regard to divergence, one might wonder if an outward
flow, such as pictured above, always means that the divergence of the
vector field is positive?</p>

<p>Here's a picture of a different vector field showing fluid flowing
outward from the origin.  However, it differs from the above vector
field in that the arrows get shorter the further they are from the
origin.  Is the divergence of this vector field positive?  In other
words, is the fluid expanding as it may look like from the picture?</p>

{% boxedapplet "outward_flowing_nondivergent_vector_field" %}

<p>To answer this question, we have to compute the divergence.  This
vector field is 
\begin{align*}
  \dlvf(x,y,z) = \frac{(x,y,z)}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{3/2}},
  \label{vecfield2}
\end{align*}
for $(x,y,z) \ne (0,0,0)$.  (It is not defined at the origin.)  This
new vector field is the same as the first vector field above except that we have divided it by its magnitude
raised to the third power. (We could write this vector field as
$\dlvf(\vc{x}) = \frac{\vc{x}}{\norm{\vc{x}}^3}$, where
$\vc{x}=(x,y,z)$.)  In this way, the vector field gets smaller as one
moves away from the origin.</p>

<p>We {%intlink divergence_curl_notation %}calculate the divergence{%endintlink%} of $\dlvf$:
\begin{align*}
  \div \dlvf(x,y,z) &amp;= \pdiff{}{x}\frac{x}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{3/2}}
  + \pdiff{}{y}\frac{y}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{3/2}} + 
  \pdiff{}{z}\frac{z}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{3/2}} 
  \\
  &amp;= \frac{(x^2+y^2+z^2) - 3x^2}
  {(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{5/2}}
  +
  \frac{(x^2+y^2+z^2) - 3y^2}
  {(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{5/2}}
  +
  \frac{(x^2+y^2+z^2) - 3z^2}
  {(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{5/2}}\\
  &amp;=
  \frac{3(x^2+y^2+z^2) - 3(x^2+y^2+z^2)}
  {(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{5/2}}
  =0
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>Hence, as long as we are not at the origin, the divergence is zero and
the flow is neither expanding nor contracting.</p>

<p>How can we reconcile this fact with the picture?  If the sphere is at the
origin, clearly the flow is out of the sphere.  But the divergence is
not defined at the origin, so we have to ignore that point.  If you
move the sphere away from the origin, it is not clear if there is more
fluid flowing into the sphere or more fluid flowing out.  On one hand,
the flow out of the sphere is slower than the flow into the sphere, as
the arrows are getting shorter.  On the other hand, because the flow
is radiating outward, the fluid is flowing out of the sphere across
more than half of its surface.  For this particular vector field, I
balanced those two effects (by carefully choosing how quickly the
vector field shrinks as one moves away from the origin) so that the
net flow into the sphere is exactly equal to the net flow out of the
sphere.  If we stay away from the origin, the fluid is neither
expanding nor compressing and the divergence is zero.</p>

{% navigation_tag "dimension" "Dimension" %}
<h4>Dependence on dimension</h4>

<p>Here's one more subtlety just for fun.  To make the divergence zero in
the above example, I balanced the outward flow of the vector field
by shrinking the vector field as one moves away from the origin.
The flow out of the sphere was equal to the flow into the
sphere and there was no expansion or compression.</p>

<p>What happens if I take the two-dimensional version of the previous vector field?  The 2D vector field is
\begin{align*}
  \dlvf(x,y) = \frac{(x,y)}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}},
\end{align*}
for $(x,y) \ne (0,0)$.  (It is not defined at the origin.)  This
vector field is shown below along with a circle that you can move by
dragging its top red point with your mouse.  Move the circle so that
it is away from the origin.  In this case, is the divergence positive,
negative, or zero?</p>

{% boxedapplet "outward_flowing_negative_divergent_vector_field_2D" %}

<p>We calculate the divergence of $\dlvf$:
\begin{align*}
  \div \dlvf(x,y) &amp;= \pdiff{}{x}\frac{x}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}
  + \pdiff{}{y}\frac{y}{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}
  \\
  &amp;= \frac{(x^2+y^2) - 3x^2}
  {(x^2+y^2)^{5/2}}
  +
  \frac{(x^2+y^2) - 3y^2}
  {(x^2+y^2)^{5/2}}
  \\
  &amp;=
  \frac{2(x^2+y^2) - 3(x^2+y^2)}
  {(x^2+y^2)^{5/2}}
  =
  \frac{-1}
  {(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}
  <0
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>In this case, away from the origin, the divergence is negative.  The
fluid is compressing even though it is flowing outward.</p>

<p>Why did the dimension make a difference?  One can see the difference
from the calculations, but what is the difference in the geometric
picture?  As in the three-dimensional case, the fluid flows into the
circle faster than it flows out of the circle, as the arrows are
getting shorter.  And, as in the three-dimensional case, because the
flow is radiating outward, the fluid is flowing out of the circle over
more than half the boundary of the circle.  But, because we are only
in two dimensions, the effect from the boundary is smaller.  I chose
the vector field to balance the two effects and make the divergence
zero in three dimensions.  But, this makes the divergence of the
two-dimensional analogue be negative.</p>

<p>You can check that the divergence of the vector field
\begin{align*}
  \dlvf(x,y) = \frac{(x,y)}{x^2+y^2}
\end{align*}
is zero but that the divergence of the three-dimensional analogue 
\begin{align*}
  \dlvf(x,y,z) = \frac{(x,y,z)}{x^2+y^2+z^2}
\end{align*}
is positive.  In general, for a number $p$, the divergence of the
vector field
\begin{align*}
  \dlvf(\vc{x}) = \frac{\vc{x}}{\norm{\vc{x}}^p}
\end{align*}
is $\div \dlvf(\vc{x}) = (3-p)/\norm{\vc{x}}^p$ in three dimensions
and is $\div \dlvf(\vc{x}) = (2-p)/\norm{\vc{x}}^p$ in two dimensions.
So you need $p=3$ to have zero divergence in three dimensions and
$p=2$ to have zero divergence in two dimensions.</p>
