<p>Stokes' theorem is a generalization of 
{%intlink greens_theorem_idea %}Green's theorem{%endintlink%}
from circulation in a planar region to circulation 
along a {%intlink parametrized_surface_introduction%}surface{%endintlink%}.

<p>Green's theorem states that, given a continuously differentiable two-dimensional
vector field $\dlvf$, the integral of the &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo;
of $\dlvf$ over the region $\dlr$ inside a {%intlink simple_curve_definition%}simple{%endintlink%} {%intlink closed_curve_definition %}closed{%endintlink%} curve $\dlc$ is equal to
the {%intlink line_integral_circulation%}total circulation{%endintlink%} of $\dlvf$ around $\dlc$, as suggested by the equation
\begin{align*}
  \dlint = \iint_\dlr \text{&ldquo;microscopic
  circulation of $\dlvf$&rdquo; } dA.
\end{align*}
We often write that $\dlc = \partial \dlr$ as fancy notation meaning simply that $\dlc$ is the boundary of $\dlr$.  Green's theorem requires that $\dlc = \partial \dlr$.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo; in Green's theorem
is captured by the {%intlink curl_idea%}curl{%endintlink%} of the vector field
and is illustrated by the green circles in the below figure.</p>

<p>Green's theorem applies only to two-dimensional vector fields
and to regions in the two-dimensional plane.   
Stokes' theorem generalizes Green's theorem to three dimensions.  For
starters, let's take our above picture and simply embed it in three
dimensions.  Then, our curve $\dlc$ becomes a curve in the $xy$-plane,
and our region $\dlr$ becomes a surface $\dls$ in the $xy$-plane whose
boundary is the curve $\dlc$.  Even though $\dls$ is now a surface, we still use the same notation as $\partial$ for the boundary.  The boundary $\partial \dls$ of the surface $\dls$ is a closed curve,  and we require that $\partial \dls = \dlc$.

<p>The next question is what the microscopic circulation along a surface
should be. For Green's theorem, we found that 
\begin{align*}
  \text{&ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo;} = (\curl \dlvf) \cdot \vc{k},
\end{align*}
(where $\vc{k}$ is the unit-vector in the $z$-direction).  We wanted
the {% intlink curl_components %}component of the curl{%endintlink%}
in the $\vc{k}$ direction because this corresponded to microscopic
circulation in the $xy$-plane.  Similarly, for a surface, we will want
the microscopic circulation along the surace.  This corresponds to the
component of the curl that is <i>perpendicular</i> to the surface,
i.e, 
\begin{align*}
  \text{&ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo;} = (\curl \dlvf) \cdot \vc{n},
\end{align*}
where $\vc{n}$ is a {% intlink parametrized_surface_normal_vector%}unit normal vector{%endintlink%} to the surface.
You can see this using the right-hand rule.  If you point the thumb of
your right hand perpendicular to a surface, your fingers will curl in
a direction corresponding to circulation parallel to the surface.</p>

<p>In summary, to go from Green's theorem to Stoke's theorem, we've made two
changes.  First, we've changed the line integral living in two
dimensions (Green's theorem) to a line integral living in three
dimensions (Stokes' theorem).  Second, we changed the double integral
of $\curl \dlvf \cdot \vc{k}$ over a region $\dlr$ in the plane
(Green's theorem) to a surface integral of $\curl \dlvf \cdot \vc{n}$
over a surface floating in space (Stokes' theorem).  The required
relationship between the curve $\dlc$ and the surface $\dls$ (Stokes'
theorem) is identical to the relationship between the curve $C$ and
the region $\dlr$ (Green's theorem): the curve $\dlc$ must be the boundary $\partial \dlr$ of the region  or the boundary $\partial \dls$ of the surface.</p>

<p>We write Stokes' theorem as:
\begin{align*}
  \dlint = \ssint{\dls}{\curl \dlvf \cdot \vc{n}} = \sint{\dls}{\curl \dlvf}
\end{align*}
(Recall that a {% intlink surface_integral_vector_field_introduction %}surface integral{%endintlink%} of a vector field is the integral
of the component of the vector field perpendicular to the surface.)
We see that the integral on the right is the surface integral of the vector
field $\curl \dlvf$.  Stokes theorem says the surface integral of $\curl
\dlvf$ over a surface $\dls$ (i.e.,
$\sint{\dls}{\curl \dlvf}$) is the circulation of $\dlvf$ around the
boundary of the surface (i.e., $\dlint$ where $\dlc = \partial \dls$ ).</p>

<p>Once we have Stokes' theorem, we can see that the surface integral of
$\curl \dlvf$ is a special integral.  The integral cannot
change if we can change the surface $\dls$ to any surface as long as
the boundary of $\dls$ is still the curve $\dlc$.  It cannot change
because it still must be equal to $\dlint$, which doesn't change if we
don't change $\dlc$.  (In analogy of how the gradient $\nabla f$ is a {% intlink conservative_vector_field_introduction%}path-independent vector field{%endintlink%}, you could say that $\curl \dlvf$ is
&ldquo;surface independent&rdquo; vector field, but we don't usually use that term.)</p>

<p>For example, staring with a planar surface such as sketched above, we
see that the surface $\dls$ doesn't have to be the flat surface inside
$\dlc$.  We can bend and stretch $\dls$, and the above formula is
still true.  In the below applet, you can move the
blue point on the slider to change the surface $\dls$.  For any of
those surfaces, the integral of the &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo; $\curl \dlvf$ over that surface will
be the total circulation $\dlint$ of $\dlvf$ around the curve $\dlc$ (shown in
red).  The important restriction is that the boundary of the surface $\dls$
is still the curve $\dlc$.</p>

{% boxedapplet "macroscopic_microscopic_circulation_three_dimensions" %}

<p>Stokes' theorem allows us to do even more.  We don't have to leave the
curve $\dlc$ sitting in the $xy$-plane.  We can twist and turn $\dlc$ as
well.  If $\dls$ is a surface whose boundary is $\dlc$ (i.e., if $\dlc = \partial \dls$), it is still true that
\begin{align*}
  \dlint = \sint{\dls}{\curl \dlvf}.
\end{align*}
For example, in the below applet, you can move the
blue point on the slider to change the surface $\dls$, as before.  But,
you can also move the green point on the slider to change the curve
$\dlc$.  The surface $\dls$ also changes as you change $\dlc$, since its
boundary has to be $\dlc$.  (Although the applet doesn't show the green circles 
representing the &ldquo;microscopic circulation,&rdquo; you can imagine what they
would look like.)</p>

{% boxedapplet "changing_surfaces_stokes_theorem" %}

<p>Note that moving the blue dot on the slider does not change the value
of either integral in the above formulas.  Since the curve $\dlc$ does
not change, the left line integral doesn't change, which means the
value of the right surface integral cannot change.  On the other hand,
moving the green dot on the slider does change the values of the
integrals since the curve $\dlc$ changes.  The important point is that,
even in this case, the left line integral and the right surface
integral are always equal.</p>

<p>There is one more subtlety that you have to get correct, or else you'll may
be off by a sign.  You need to {%intlink stokes_theorem_orientation%}orient the 
surface and boundary properly{%endintlink%}.</p>

<p>You can read some examples {%intlink stokes_theorem_examples %}here{%endintlink%}.</p>
