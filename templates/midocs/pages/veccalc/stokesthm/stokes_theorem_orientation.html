{% title "Proper orientation for Stokes' theorem" %}
{% description "The importance of orientating the surface and its boundary correctly when using Stokes' theorem." %}

<p>One important subtlety of {%intlink stokes_theorem_idea%}Stokes' theorem{%endintlink%} is orientation.
We need to be careful about 
{%intlink parametrized_surface_orient %}orientating the surface{%endintlink%} (which is specified by the {%intlink parametrized_surface_normal_vector%}normal vector{%endintlink%} $\vc{n}$) properly with respect to the {%intlink parametrized_curve_orient%}orientation of the boundary{%endintlink%}
(which is specified by the tangent vector).
Remember, changing the
orientation of the surface changes the sign of the surface integral.  If
we choose the wrong $\vc{n}$ (i.e., the wrong orientation), we could
be off by a minus sign.</p>

<p>Look at the below applet from the {%intlink stokes_theorem_idea%}Stokes' theorem introduction{%endintlink%},
where the &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo; is sketched by green
circles on the surface.  Notice how the arrows on the little green
circles (indicating the &ldquo;microscopic circulation&rdquo;) are aligned with
the red arrow indicating the direction of the curve $\dlc$.  If, for
example, the arrows on the green circles were going the other
direction, the green circles and the red curve wouldn't match, and we'd
be off by a minus sign.</p>

{% boxedapplet "macroscopic_microscopic_circulation_three_dimensions" %}

<p>Looking from the positive $z$-axis, both the green circles and the red
curve indicate counterclockwise circulation.  To define the
orientation for Green's theorem, this was sufficient.  We simply
insisted that you orient the curve $\dlc$ in the counterclockwise
fashion.  For Stokes' theorem, we cannot just say &ldquo;counterclockwise,&rdquo;
since the orientation that is counterclockwise depends on the
direction from which you are looking.  If you take the applet and rotate it
$180^\circ$ so that you are looking at it from the negative $z$-axis,
the same curve would look like it was oriented in the clockwise
fashion.  Since the green circles would also look like they are
oriented in a clockwise fashion, you can still see that the green
circles and the red curve match.</p>

<p>Remember, too, that the curve $\dlc$ can be floating or twisted in any
direction.  It doesn't have to look as simple as in the above examples.
Thankfully, choosing the correct orientation doesn't have to be too
difficult if you remember the right hand rule.  If you look at your
right hand from the side of your thumb, your fingers curl in the
counterclockwise direction.  Think of your thumb as the normal vector
$\vc{n}$ of a surface.  If your thumb points to the
{%intlink positive_side_definition%}positive side{%endintlink%} of
the surface, your
fingers indicate the circulation corresponding to $\curl \dlvf \cdot
\vc{n}$.  If you put your hand near the edge of the surface, the curve
$\dlc$ must be oriented to go around the same direction your fingers are
pointing.  If the relationship between the normal vector $\vc{n}$ and
the orientation of $\dlc$ doesn't match the relationship between the thumb
and fingers of your right hand, you'll be off by a minus sign.</p>

<p>Another way of thinking about the proper orientation is the following.
Imagine that you are walking on the {%intlink positive_side_definition%}positive side{%endintlink%} of the surface.  If you walk near the edge of the
surface in the direction corresponding to the orientation of $\dlc$, then
surface must be to your left and the edge $\dlc$ must be to your right.</p>

<p>When the curve $\dlc$ and the surface $\dls$ are oriented as described above
so that Stokes' theorem applies, we say that $\dlc$ is a {%intlink positively_oriented_boundary_definition%}positively
oriented boundary{%endintlink%} of $\dls$.</p>
